    <P>
      Exactly one month has passed since I’ve announced
      what I’ve been doing the last half year: I’ve started building
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://muffin.cafe">Muffin</Link>
      ,
      a modern way of managing content on websites.
    </P>

    <P>
      Since then, a lot of progress happened. First off, it
      now has it’s own
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/muffin">GitHub organisation</Link>
      {' '}
      that contains all of the
      repos that are related to it. And yes, I’ve already
      asked the guy who currently owns the “muffin” username, if he could
      release it. Let’s hope that will happen soon!
    </P>

    <P>
      But there’s also a great news regarding usernames: After emailing
      the guy who owned the “muffin” package on npm, he agreed
      to release it. I didn’t even had to do something in exchange. I just
      love the open source community and everything around it!
    </P>

    <P>
      I’ve also came to the conclusion that it’s probably a better
      idea to just leave all of its repositories public while developing. This
      way, it’s easier for other developers to help me with
      bringing it to a stable version.
    </P>

    <H2>Ember</H2>

    <P>
      As you might have already noticed by now, the repository
      called “old” contains a lot of commits. Not only because I’ve added
      a lot to the main system, but also because it was
      rewritten a lot of times:
    </P>

    <P>
      But in the middle of the process, something started bugging me: There
      didn’t seem to be a way to simply add the API to the
      Ember app (only mockups) and all in all, I thought making the
      server-side stuff a separate repo/package will make development
      much more complex for contributors. So I’ve switched
      back to server-side rendered.
    </P>

    <P>
      A few months later, I was struggling with building my own workflow for all of the
      things that are necessary for building a modern web
      app: ES2015 module bundling and resolving, running the web
      and livereloading server while also watching files
      and rebuilding if necessary and much more things of that kind.
    </P>

    <P>
      While I think that I’ve found a clean way to solve all of this, it was
      still too slow and complex. So asked myself: “Do you really
      want to rewrite all of this again?” No. Of course not. But I did!
    </P>

    <P>
      So in favour of making Muffin the most modern content management
      system, I’ve moved the core system to the repo called “old” and created
      new ones for the “client” and the API (“server”). In those
      repositories, I’ll now continue making the system stable.
    </P>

    <P>
      And hell yeah, it’s better! Way better. — In the first few days, I’ve already
      noticed that it’s much easier to add features and
      iterate over stuff. And the best thing about that: It will allow me
      to add many of those shiny new web things like web sockets
      and service workers to the application easily. So all in
      all, I definitely don’t regret this decision!
    </P>

    <H2>{`So, What's Next?`}</H2>

    <P>
      After having rebuilt the whole app using Ember, I will now
      continue adding more features to it and bring it to a stable version.
    </P>

    <P>
      Since some releases we’re already in use in that old “muffin” package
      on npm, the first release will be 1.0.0 and not 0.1.0. Because of this, I’ll have
      to make muffin stable for production before publishing
      the first release (like specified on
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://semver.org">SemVer</Link>
      ).
