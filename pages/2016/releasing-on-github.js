    <Meta id="releasing-on-github" />

    <P>
      Every since programmers have started writing applications
      for the general public, there has always been that weird structural
      mess when thinking about how we should actually make them available
      to people who‚Äôre not so involved in what we‚Äôre doing (or even to ourselves).
    </P>

    <P>
      In turn, many of us have come up with their own concepts
      of how it should be done. Some folks even created very explicit
      guidelines with the intention of making their team move faster
      while keeping a consistent style.
    </P>

    <P>
      The community‚Äôs huge demand for a straightforward
      way of doing it has also led to the creation of things like
      Semantic Versioning, GitHub Releases and various open-source
      projects for automatically generating releases for your application.
    </P>

    <P>
      Today, I‚Äôm pretty comfortable with saying that we‚Äôre in a
      good position when it comes to the availability of concepts
      and small studies about how to properly publish releases for software.
    </P>

    <P>
      However‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas with many things in our industry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere‚Äôs
      still a lot of bikeshedding going on.
    </P>

    <P>
      We‚Äôll probably never reach the point where everybody agrees on
      the same opinions. Rather than that, there will most likely always
      be people who‚Äôre stubborn enough to completely ignore the benefits
      that the industry would be deriving from a consistent workflow.
    </P>

    <H2>But Who Cares, Right? üòã</H2>

    <P>
      Instead of complaining about the problems of our industry, I‚Äôd like
      to take the chance and propose a new, simple concept for properly
      taking advantage of GitHub‚Äôs release mechanism.
    </P>

    <P>
      Increasing our common ground in this area helps the whole
      community to move forward faster and allows developers to
      focus on their actual software instead of wondering about
      the perfect setup for the releases.
    </P>

    <P>Got it? Then let‚Äôs start with...</P>

    <H2>The Basics</H2>

    <P>
      Assuming that you‚Äôd like to publish <b>version 0.2.0</b> of a certain
      project, the first thing you need to do is open up your repository on GitHub.
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>
      Now let your eyes float over the statistic bar at the
      top (the one with the colored bar at the bottom) and click on this section:
    </P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2016/releasing-on-github/section.png" />

    <P>
      Next, the ‚ÄúReleases‚Äù page will open. This is the place where
      the users of your software will later be looking for a descriptive
      list of what changed in each new update.
    </P>

    <P>
      At the moment, you haven‚Äôt created any releases yet and
      GitHub is asking you to create one. So let‚Äôs go ahead, hit the button:
    </P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2016/releasing-on-github/new.png" />

    <P>
      Now you‚Äôre on the most important page of all: The one that
      allows you to create a new release. To be more precise, you
      should currently be looking at the four most important fields:
    </P>

    <H3>Tag Version</H3>

    <P>
      Because you want to publish version 0.2.0 of your project, you
      need to set this field to ‚Äú0.2.0‚Äù.
    </P>

    <P>
      While some people might suggest you to prefix the version
      with ‚Äúv‚Äù, I highly recommend against that: It‚Äôs clear that
      each new release also requires the increase of the version
      number (like stated <Link href="http://semver.org">here</Link>).
    </P>

    <H3>Target Commit</H3>

    <P>
      Whenever you create a new commit using GitHub Releases, it will
      automatically generate a Git Tag for you. In order to create this
      tag, the platform needs to know which commit it should point to.
    </P>

    <P>
      By default, it will point to the last commit on the master
      branch. If you want to select a specific commit (you should only
      choose commits that are part of the release bundle), simply
      click on the button and switch it.
    </P>

    <H3>Release Title</H3>

    <P>
      I recommend leaving this one empty. This will simply
      instruct GitHub to use the version number as the release title.
    </P>

    <P>
      However, if you‚Äôd like to surprise your users with a
      interesting, thoughtful phrase (or just a stupid arrangement
      of words), you can also put that one in and ensure a
      unique style that people will associate with you.
    </P>

    <H3>Changelog</H3>

    <P>
      This multi-line text field is the most important part
      of the whole release. It indicates the changes made
      and how they‚Äôll affect the user.
    </P>

    <P>
      Although this is a completely free-form text
      field, I highly suggest following the strict concept
      of Semantic Versioning. This means that you‚Äôll end
      up with three headings:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Major Changes</LI>
      <LI>Minor Changes</LI>
      <LI>Patches</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      Each section should start with a heading of the third
      type (three hashes in markdown) and contain a bullet list of changes
      with a quick explanation about what exactly changed, how it
      affects the end user and Links to the commits, pull requests and
      issues that are related to it.
    </P>

    <H2>The Finish Line&nbsp;.......&nbsp;üèÉ‚Äç</H2>

    <P>
      Once you‚Äôve filled out all of these fields, you‚Äôre
      ready to publish your first release! Just hit
      the ‚Äúpublish release‚Äù button and it will be live. After that, your
      users will be able to look up the changes made in each
      new update directly on GitHub.
    </P>

    <P>
      This ensures transparency, shows your fans that you‚Äôre
      caring about your creations and makes sure that people will
      update their copy of your software to a release that fixes
      a certain bug instead of simply reporting it again (less work for you).
    </P>

    <P>Some other great advantages of releasing on GitHub:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        You can use their
        {' '}
        <Link href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/">API</Link>
        {' '}
        to show
        the changelog somewhere else: Need it on your website? Or maybe even directly
        in the application? Easy!
      </LI>

      <LI>
        A consistent changelog structure allows people
        to easily parse the content of your releases and display them in their own style.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Assuming that all developers are going to handle their software releases
        like mentioned above, we‚Äôll be able to minimise the amount of
        confusion that gets created from everyone swearing by a different
        technique. In turn, we‚Äôll move much faster collectively.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Examples</H2>

    <P>
      Here‚Äôs a list of selected repositories on which
      I‚Äôve applied this technique (all of them are built
      on top of <Link href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</Link>):
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        <Link href="https://github.com/zeit/now-desktop/releases">
          Now Desktop
        </Link>

    </UL>

    <H2>Exceptions</H2>

    <P>
      We‚Äôre not living in a world where everything is just
      black or white. Although the concept mentioned above is
      perfectly for most projects, there might still be some
      cases in which the kind of software you‚Äôre releasing isn‚Äôt
      suitable for this release structure.
    </P>

    <P>
      What you should do in these cases is carefully
      try to adapt the technique and if it doesn‚Äôt work
      for your project, simply modify it slightly.
    </P>

    <P>
      But keep in mind: Our goal is to avoid as much
      confusion as possible. So each repository that‚Äôs not
      fitting for this way of releasing software, should at
      least adapt as much as possible from the things mentioned above!
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P><b>{`That's it! ‚úîÔ∏è`}</b></P>

    <P>
      Now go out there and make sure that as many of your
      GitHub repositories as possible have proper releases in
      place. Thank you for caring about the welfare of
      our community/industry/whatever!
