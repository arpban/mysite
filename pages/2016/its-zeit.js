    <P>
      On March the 30th, around midnight,
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://twitter.com/rauchg">Guillermo Rauch</Link>
      {' '}
      received
      an email from a guy who had noticed earlier that the person
      he was writing to was in the process of establishing a new company.
    </P>

    <P>
      And since the sender of said message has already been
      a huge fan of Guillermo’s previous projects, he was asking whether
      or not he could help pushing it forward.
    </P>

    <P>A few hours later, Mr. Rauch answered.</P>

    <P>
      Now, almost 4 months later, a lot of awesome work has been
      created: Designs, Concepts and Open Source software. All of
      them have contributed to
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://zeit.co">ZEIT</Link>
      {' '}— a company whose
      mission it is to build great cloud solutions and
      software for developers and other creatives.
    </P>

    <P>I’m that guy.</P>

    <P>Why? Me?! A 18-year-old teenager?</P>

    <P>
      I mean, just a few months before this happened, I’ve
      decided to end my apprenticeship at a local agency, drop out of
      vocational school and
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://medium.com/@leo/im-going-freelance">focus</Link>
      {' '}
      on
      doing high quality work for a handful of clients which
      I had known from working for various other teams for the last 7 years.
    </P>

    <P>And guess what? Now <b>I’m joining ZEIT full-time</b>! 🎉</P>

    <P>
      It’s funny, isn’t it? Yea, in the beginning I couldn’t believe
      it either. But it looks like — thanks to all of the effort I’ve
      pushed into this whole dream of creating awesome software — someone
      finally decided to hand me the freedom, resources and options to unleash
      my full potential.
    </P>

    <P>
      From now on, I’ll be leading
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/zeit">Open Source</Link>
      {' '}
      and
      everything related to our community-facing projects.
    </P>

    <P>
      But enough of this! I don’t want to reveal
      too much. If you like good software and neat products in general (I’m sure you do), just
      follow
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://twitter.com/notquiteleo">me</Link>
      {' '}
      and
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://twitter.com/zeithq">ZEIT</Link>
      ,
      grab some 🍿 and be amazed! 😛
