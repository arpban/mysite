    <P>
      If you have read one of my posts lately, you were
      probably able to figure out that my personal site runs on Jekyll — the most
      known static site generator in the world of Ruby.
    </P>

    <P>
      Not only am I a really huge fan of it, but it was also the
      biggest part of the intention that helped me start blogging again.
    </P>

    <P>
      Now, about one year after I’ve made the first commit, I felt
      like it didn’t manage to live up to my expectations
      anymore: Not only have I learned an awful lot about web
      tooling, but I also came across many better ways to
      accomplish certain tasks while developing a project.
    </P>

    <P>
      So I’ve asked myself: “There’s a shit ton of things
      you’d like to change in front of you, why
      don’t you try making one yourself?”.
    </P>

    <P>
      And while I definitely had in mind that it’s usually not
      such a good idea to reinvent the wheel (especially
      on the web, where a lot of stuff can easily be modified
      through pull requests), I did it.
    </P>

    <P>
      I not just wanted to create a copy of existing packages
      for the fun of it, but rather a completely new
      one that combines all of my knowledge into a fast, up-to-date static
      site generator written in pure JavaScript.
    </P>

    <P>So here it is: <Link href="https://github.com/leo/cory">Cory</Link>.</P>

    <P>
      If you’re looking for such a generator but
      haven’t yet made your choice, you definitely need to give it a try.
    </P>

    <P>
      Just take a few minutes of your time and get ready
      to enjoy what the web has to offer today: Clean, logic-less templates written
      in either
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</Link>
      {' '}
      or Markdown, JavaScript
      transpiling,
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</Link>
      , gzip’d files, an
      automated deployment workflow for GitHub, source-maps and etc.!
    </P>

    <P>
      And since it’s written in JavaScript, it’s easy for all
      the frontend people to help us with adding features and fixing bugs.
    </P>
