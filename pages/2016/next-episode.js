    <P>
      More than two months have passed since I wrote
      my last post. In those two months, a lot of stuff happened:
    </P>

    <P>
      I’ve decided to leave my old
      employer
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://medienreaktor.de">medienreaktor</Link>
      {' '}
      in favour of going
      a completely different way than the one someone
      in my age would normally go. My initial idea was to start
      freelancing, and that’s also what I’m currently doing. However, I’m
      not really sure if it will stay that way. So instead of just
      going on with my work, I’ve also decided to pull some additional levers.
    </P>

    <P>
      And in the next few months, one of those might turn
      out to be better for me than just playing the lone wolf and doing
      everything alone. While I’m very proud to finally be able
      to pay for my own life by myself, I also miss how much
      fun it is to work together with a team. Nevertheless, I wanted
      to grow into a different, extended direction.
    </P>

    <P>
      So it’s still the best decision I could make. I finally have
      more time to focus on the new stuff that’s currently happening on the
      web. I’ve learned a lot about JavaScript’s latest
      standard (ES2015), web tooling, how to create such tools and
      also finally strengthened my design skills.
    </P>

    <P>
      All in all, I feel like I have more time to enjoy what
      really matters to be: Building great software.
    </P>

    <P>
      However, I definitely need to find a way to combine this new way of
      being with a better social environment than the one I currently have. It does
      make an awful lot of fun to write and design such things, but
      it makes even more fun to do so with a awesome team.
    </P>

    <P>
      But as I said: The next few months will decide how I proceed with this.
    </P>

    <P>
      Another big thing that happened to my life. It took me nearly
      half a year to convert my thoughts and ideas into a working product. At
      first, it was really tough. And when I say “really”, I
      mean “really”. I’ve created a lot of things on the web, but this one
      is without doubt the biggest one of all.
    </P>

    <P>
      More than four complete iterations of the design, multiple rewrites
      of the whole codebase and countless cups of tea went into it. But
      all in all, it was definitely worth it.
    </P>

      it’s awesome, take a read at

    <P>
      Thanks to my new schedule, I was also able to finally start
      journaling again. For the past months, it was something I simply
      didn’t have enough time for. Text seems simple, if you can
      just read it. But if you’re writing, it consumes a lot of effort and time.
    </P>

    <P>
      Nevertheless, it’s awesome to be able to look back on what
      you’ve done in your life. And that outweighs all of
      the trouble. It allows you to...
