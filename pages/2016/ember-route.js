      When I first came in touch with Ember.js to build the client-side
      rendered version of
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://muffin.cafe">Muffin</Link>
      , I was looking for a way to add the name
      of the currently active route to the body. I needed it
      because I wanted certain styles to only be applied to the elements
      within a certain route.
    </P>

    <P>
      So after looking around the web for a few minutes, I’ve
      found
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/AddJam/ember-body-class">
        ember-body-class
      </Link>
      {' '}— an
      add-on which does exactly that. If you just want to take
      advantage of the body classes that are based on the route name, you
      don’t even need to configure a single thing!
    </P>

    <P>
      And what’s even more awesome is that you can easily extend
      the list of classes by simply adding them to an array
      available under the “className” property:
    </P>

    <Code language="javascript" syntax={js}>
      {`export default Ember.route.extend({
  classNames: ['strawberry-jam']
})`}
    </Code>

    <P>So all in all a pretty great solution, right? Definitely!</P>

    <P>
      But yesterday, I took some of my time and decided to kick
      out some of the add-ons that aren’t really needed. Mostly because
      each of them of course adds another big bag of code to the compiled Ember app.
    </P>

    <P>
      So after looking for ways to solve this problem within an additional add-on, I came
      across
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://dockyard.com/blog/ember/2013/03/27/body-class-tags-in-ember">
        DockYard’s solution
      </Link>
      . It
      picks the name of the current route (“users.edit” for example), replaces
      all dots with dashes and finally adds it to the body’s “class” attribute.
    </P>

    <P>
      However, I wanted a solution that mimics the behaviour of
      ember-body-class. What I mean with this is that the
      parts of the route (“users” and “edit”) shouldn’t be treated as a
      single class named “users-edit”, but rather added to the body
      as separate classes.
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>Because of this, I came up with a improved solution:</P>

    <P>
      I’ve generated a new initializer and
      called it “setup-route”. Then I’ve added the following methods to it:
    </P>

    <Code language="javascript" syntax={js}>
      {`Ember.Route.reopen({
  activate () {
    var classes = this.genClasses()

    if (classes !== 'application') {
      Ember.$('body').addClass(classes)
    }
  },
  deactivate () {
    Ember.$('body').removeClass(this.genClasses())
  },
  genClasses () {
    var classes = this.routeName.split('.')

    if (this.classNames) {
      for (var name of this.classNames) {
        classes.push(name)
      }
    }

    return classes.join(' ')
  }
})`}
    </Code>

    <P>So there you have it!</P>

    <P>
      The easiest way to add the name of the current route as
      a class to the body, without an add-on. It completely imitates
      the behaviour of ember-body-class and even allows you to
      extend the list of classes by using the “classNames” property on your route.
    </P>
