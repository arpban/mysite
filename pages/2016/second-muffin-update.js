    <P>
      Here we are. Exactly 28 days since the last status
      update, I’m about to tell you another nice story about what’s new, what
      had to be dropped from the project and why I
      did it like that and not just kept it like it was!
    </P>

    <P>Let’s start over with the biggest change:</P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2016/second-muffin-update/terminal.png" />

    <H2>Goodbye Yeoman, Hello Custom CLI!</H2>

    <P>
      First off, I’d like to encourage you to dive really deep into
      the topic of choosing between building your own CLI and
      using Yeoman if you’re currently in the process of building
      something that needs blueprints and other tasks
      to be generated/handled through the command line.
    </P>

    <P>
      Why? Because it’s important to choose a tool
      based on what you need it to do. Don’t just show
      this essay to your CTO and be like:
    </P>

    <Quote>
      Hehehe! Told ya! A custom CLI is better than that
      just letting that stupid Yeoman thingy handle most
      of the stuff for us.
    </Quote>

    <P>
      No! Addy Osmani, Sindre Sorhus and all the other
      contributors didn’t just create it for fun. They’ve actually
      solved a lot of problems by giving developers a new, easy
      way to generate their own blueprints and handle different
      other tasks for a certain type of web app.
    </P>

    <P>
      However, Muffin isn’t just another blueprint/boilerplate
      for writing unique websites. Rather than that, it’s a full-blown
      toolkit that handles all of the tasks from just
      serving your site to transferring its contents between different
      environments and even building your assets.
    </P>

    <P>
      While some of those things could be handled within
      that generator, it seemed much cleaner to me to create a whole
      new toolkit for it. Yeoman isn’t made for all that stuff. Its
      main purpose is to scaffold your site and help you set
      up the tools you’ll need in the process of developing
      it (and not to act as such a tool).
    </P>

    <P>
      Because of this I’ve decided to convert the
      core of Muffin into something similar to a command line utility.
    </P>

    <P>
      I’ve spend hours and hours pondering this, but finally came
      to the conclusion that it will save both us (the developers
      behind the project) and Muffin’s users a lot of
      time and effort if I’ll let people control it through the
      command line instead of requiring it into an existing app.
    </P>

    <P>
      This whole thing also has a nice side effect: Developers
      don’t need to install and update both Yeoman and Muffin’s generator
      anymore. They only need to download and globally
      install the core package and boom: Done!
    </P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2016/second-muffin-update/broccoli.png" />

    <H2>Broccoli.js</H2>

    <P>
      No, I’m not talking about the vegetable. I’m talking about
      the most awesome
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://broccolijs.com">asset pipeline/build tool</Link>
      {' '}
      I’ve seen in my
      whole career as a web dev. I’ve came across it while getting
      started with ember-cli (they’re using it too).
    </P>

    <P>
      So far, Gulp served me pretty well with all the stuff I had
      to be done in combination with Muffin. However, there’s something
      else to be considered: Allowing people to choose their
      own build tool creates a lot of room for errors. And we
      as a community would have a really hard time fixing all
      of those and responding to questions because everyone would
      have a different setup and completely different tasks to solve.
    </P>

    <P>
      By choosing Broccoli as the asset pipeline, we not
      only make sure that everything is as straightforward
      as possible, but we also <b>max out the performance</b> of
      the building process.
    </P>

    <P>
      Thanks to the fact that Muffin now also contains a
      whole, custom command line utility, it wasn’t very hard to
      integrate it into the existing workflow. I just had to
      require the module, use its API to build a few awesome
      tasks and finally implement a neat command for the whole job:
    </P>

    <Code language="bash" syntax={bash}>muffin build</Code>

    <P>
      When running this command, Muffin will now look for
      a “brocfile.js” in your site’s root directory and then use the
      tasks you’ve added within it to compile your Sass code, transpile
      your next-gen JavaScript and move the static
      files over to the “dist” directory without touching them.
    </P>

    <P>
      Broccoli gets all of this stuff done at an insanely high
      speed! Since it doesn’t have to handle all of the stuff
      that a full-blown task manager does, it currently seems to
      even be the fastest asset pipeline at all out there.
    </P>

    <P>
      And if that wasn’t awesome enough, you’re still able to
      require Broccoli plugins and completely adjust
      the “brocfile.js” to your own needs.
    </P>

    <H2>2.0.0</H2>

    <P>
      As developers, we’ve all read
      the
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</Link>
      {' '}
      guide. Right?
      Definitely! And because of this, it seemed like a hugely important
      thing to me to make sure that the initial development
      version of Muffin gets released under two conditions:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>A correct version tag (not just start with 4.3.2).</LI>

      <LI>
        The chosen tag should leave enough space to the
        top, since I’m planning to release a lot of new features
        and fixes which of will of course require
        increasing the version number.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      However, I wasn’t fully able to meet my own
      expectations when I released the first version of Muffin: v1.0.0
    </P>

    <P>
      See? You didn’t even knew that this version already
      went online, right? No, you probably didn’t. The reason for
      this is that I wasn’t sure if I’ll even keep this name
      or just switch to a different one.
    </P>

    <P>
      Why did I even think about that? Because I’ve wanted
      those to check those two points above so badly. And
      since someone was using the “muffin” package name before me, I
      had to start at 1.0.0 (which I didn’t like because
      I thought 1.0.0 would be too huge for the initial unstable release).
    </P>

    <P>
      And now, since I have rewritten the whole thing into
      something like a CLI, I would have to bump the version to 2.0.0.
    </P>

    <P>
      “Way too big, that version!”, I’ve told myself. I simply
      didn’t wanted to end up at 10.0.0 in two years.
    </P>

    <P>
      However, after asking a few other devs, I’ve looked at it with
      from a completely different angle: It’s not much of a
      problem to bump the version tag so far. As long as I
      make sure to fix a lot of bugs and make it as stable as possible
      before releasing that version, there will still be
      enough room for other breaking changes!
    </P>

    <H2>Final Words</H2>

    <P>
      Those changes mentioned above weren’t all ones. Just the
      biggest ones! So get ready for experiencing how Muffin
      is <Link href="https://github.com/muffin">going to meet</Link> the
      expectations generated by its slogan:
    </P>

    <P>Oh. And as always:</P>

    <P>
      Thanks for caring about what will happen with the web
      in the future! The more people care about creating awesome workflows
      and tools, the easier and more fun it will get for all of us.
