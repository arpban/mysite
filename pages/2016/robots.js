    <P>
      When I attended my
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://2015.jsconf.eu">first conference</Link>
      {' '}
      at
      the end of last year, all of my expectations
      have been exceeded completely. One thing that especially
      blew my mind was how much they were talking
      about hardware, rather than just how to build
      better websites with JS.
    </P>

    <P>
      As an example, Pawel Szymczykowski was
      giving
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzBloghQhO4">a talk</Link>
      {' '}
      about
      how to build a balloon carrying a payload
      of sensors and cameras driven by JavaScript that flies
      twice the height of a commercial airline. After
      that (or before, I honestly don’t remember the order), Thomas
      Watson showed us
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5GlZp6L9P4">a way</Link>
      {' '}
      to hack
      Apple’s AirPlay protocol and easily setup
      a server to which we can stream music. And
      many more!
    </P>

    <P>
      Despite the fact that I already knew that
      there was a lot going on in the area of controlling hardware
      with JavaScript, I really wasn’t expecting
      it to be so easy: By taking advantage of Node’s extremely
      huge module ecosystem, you only need to write
      a few lines of code to make a servo spin, light
      up an LED or even show
      something on a LC display.
    </P>

    <P>
      These things will definitely get more complex, as you
      dive deeper into the world of building
      robots and programming hardware in general. But just for
      getting started, there’s not a lot of
      knowledge required. To proof this, I’d like to give
      you a quick overview of what you need to do
      to make something like an LED respond
      to your Node.js program.
    </P>

    <H2>Requirements</H2>

    <P>
      For the beginning, we’ll need a
      so-called “microcontroller” (or “board”). It’s a small
      and cheap device that contains a
      processor, memory and peripherals. Today’s micro-controllers
      are often embedded in things like
      automobiles, phones and washing machines.
    </P>

    <P>
      There are several different kinds of programmable
      micro-controllers out there on the market. But
      for now, we just need one: Because I had a very
      good experience with it so far, I suggest
      going with <Link href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</Link> (outside
      of the US, it’s called “Genuino” because of
      a
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://www.open-electronics.org/from-arduino-to-genuino-the-reasons-for-a-choice/">
        trademark issue
      </Link>
      ). Besides
      of that, it’s also the recommended board of
      the library we’re going to use to control it using Node.
    </P>

    <P>
      To be able to make the example project
      happening, you only need the board itself, a USB cable
      of type A/B and a set of LEDs.
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        However, I generally recommend buying
        the
        {' '}
        <b>Starter Kit</b>
        {' '}
        (
        <Link href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit">
          US
        </Link>
        /
        <Link href="https://store.arduino.cc/product/GKX00007">
          other countries
        </Link>
        ) because
        it contains a huge varity of other components
        as well. This makes it easier for you to continue building
        various things after making it through this article.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        If you’d like to protect your USB ports from getting
        overloaded, I also suggest buying a <b>
          USB hub with
          overload protection
        </b> (like <Link href="http://amzn.to/2iBXkdX">this one</Link>). But
        if you’re using a high-quality device
        like a MacBook, this shouldn’t be necessary because the
        system will automatically shut down the port if
        something unexpected happens.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        And if you’re really into making sure that it
        gets done properly, you can also
        order
        {' '}
        <b>a case</b>
        {' '}
        (
        <Link href="http://amzn.to/2jokB0k">this one</Link>
        {' '}
        is
        mine) which protects the main board from
        getting damaged. In this case, you’ll also have to
        get a cross-tip screwdriver, if you don’t have one.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      In the next section of this tutorial, I’m just going
      to assume that you’ve bought everything mentioned above. If something
      hasn’t arrived yet, make sure
      to

      this
      article and revisit it later.
    </P>

    <H2>Setup</H2>

    <P>
      Once all of the accessories have arrived
      in your mail, make sure to unpack the board and put it into
      the case (each of these usually comes with
      some kind of instruction paper which contains information
      on how to screw the cover to the board).
    </P>

    <P>
      Now stick the A part (the bigger one) of the USB
      cable into the external hub, the B part into
      the board and finally the hub into a female
      USB port of your computer.
    </P>

    <P>
      If you’re not using a USB hub, just plug the
      A part into the computer and the other side into the board.
    </P>

    <P>
      When everything is connected, you should see a
      small, greenish LED light up constantly on
      the Arduino or Genuino. As you can see, it says
      the word “ON” next to it. This means the
      board is powered and able to accept signals
      from your computer.
    </P>

    <P>
      But please don’t worry if that’s not the
      case! Instead of a continuously lighting up LED, there
      might also be an orange one blinking. This
      simply means that the default protocol hasn’t been
      set up correctly. You’ll learn how to do
      that later in this article!
    </P>

    <H2>Preparing the Board for Accepting Tasks</H2>

    <P>
      As I’ve mentioned above, we’re now able to tell the
      micro-controller what to do using code. So let’s
      dive into running an actual program!
    </P>

    <P>
      First off, it’s important to know that the
      Starter Kit and all of the official guides related to the
      board are designed specifically for running their
      own language on it (basically a simplified version of C++).
    </P>

    <P>
      For getting the code to run on the board, they’ve designed
      an open-source IDE that let’s you write code
      and upload it to the micro controller
      with a single click.
    </P>

    <P>
      But since we’re trying to control it with
      JavaScript, this isn’t the right approach for us. Instead
      of that, we’re going to use a Node.js library
      called “Johnny Five” that runs on your computer and
      talks to the Arduino using the
      so-called “Firmata” protocol — a standard protocol
      for computers communicating with hardware devices.
    </P>

    <P>
      Because of this, we need to make sure that the board
      is able to accept tasks over this protocol as
      the next step. To do that, we’re going
      to
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">download</Link>
      {' '}
      the
      Arduino app (the IDE I’ve mentioned before), open
      it and select the default version of the
      protocol in the menu bar:
    </P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2016/robots/protocol.png" />

    <P>
      This will insert the code of the default protocol
      into the editor you’re seeing on your screen. However, the
      code isn’t on the board yet. For that, we’ll
      have to upload it. But before doing so, I suggest
      making sure that the program knows where to find the Arduino.
    </P>

    <P>
      Assuming that you’re on macOS, you can click
      on “Tools” in the menu bar, select “Board” and
      choose “Arduino/Genuino Uno”:
    </P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2016/robots/tools-board.png" />

    <P>
      Now the app knows which kind of micro-controller
      you’re using. However, it still isn’t able to
      connect to the board because it doesn’t know the
      port on which it’s plugged in.
    </P>

    <P>
      So please look for an item in
      the “Port” sub-menu of “Tools” that shows the “Arduino/Genuino Uno” type
      as suffix:
    </P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2016/robots/tools-port.png" />

    <P>
      Once you’re done setting up the basic configuration
      as mentioned above, you’re able to upload the
      protocol script to the board by clicking the tiny
      arrow on the top left in the window (the second
      icon from the left). When hovering it, a label
      saying “Upload” should appear. Click it and the program will
      move the script over to your micro controller.
    </P>

    <P>
      Yeeeha! You’ve prepared the Arduino for accepting
      the tasks you’ll be sending from the computer
      using Node. So please feel free to close the
      app and move back to your Desktop.
    </P>

    <P>
      The board should now show a green light which
      says “ON” next to it. If that’s not the case, please
      try re-connecting it to your machine and hit
      the red “RESET” button on the board. If that
      still doesn’t change make the green LED light up,
      consider
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://gitter.im/rwaldron/johnny-five">
        asking the community for help
      </Link>
      .
    </P>

    <H2>Telling the Board What to Do</H2>

    <P>
      Now that the hardware knows what to do with your
      commands, let’s set up a new Node project within a random
      directory and
      install
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">the library</Link>
      {' '}
      we’re
      going to use to communicate with the device:
    </P>

    <Code language="bash" syntax={bash}>
      {`$ npm init -y
$ npm install johnny-five -S`}
    </Code>

    <P>
      If you’re not completely fimilar with these commands: The
      first one creates a file called “package.json” with
      the default contents suggested by npm. The second
      one installs the Johnny Five library and saves it
      to the dependencies within the “package.json” file.
    </P>

    <P>
      Within that directory, create another file
      named “index.js” and start the first line with loading
      the library and initializing a new board by
      creating an instance of the “Board” class
      contained within Johnny Five:
    </P>

    <Code language="javascript" syntax={js}>
      {`const five = require('johnny-five')
const board = new five.Board()`}
    </Code>

    <P>
      As soon as you’ve initialized a new
      micro-controller (your Arduino) using the syntax shown
      above, you can start listening to the board’s “ready” event
      (which gets triggered once the board is able
      to accept signals).
    </P>

    <P>
      Inside of such an event listener, you can
      trigger actions on your components and make them
      do various things. In this example, we’re
      simply going to make a green LED blink.
    </P>

    <P>
      To accomplish this, you take one out of the Starter Kit
      and put the short part into the pin
      with the <b>number 13</b> and the long part into
      the pin named <b>“GND”</b> right above the another one.
    </P>

    <P>
      Now that the LED is able to draw power from the
      micro controller, we can create the event
      listener (as well as a new instance of
      the “Led” class imported from the library) and make the
      LED light up every 500 milliseconds using the “.blink” method:
    </P>

    <Code language="javascript" syntax={js}>
      {`board.on('ready', function() {
  const led = new five.Led(13)
  led.blink(500)
})`}
    </Code>

    <P>
      Ready? Great! Then let’s <b>run the program</b> using Node
      and see what happens with our micro controller...
    </P>

    <Code language="bash" syntax={bash}>{`$ node index`}</Code>

    <P>
      If everything has been configured correctly and
      the program is running without an error, you
      should see a few messages in your terminal indicating
      that the device was detected and the connection
      was opened. In turn, your Arduino should act like this:
    </P>

    <Image
      src="/static/essays/2016/robots/board.gif"
      origin="http://johnny-five.io"
    />

    <P>
      Cool, huh? You’ve just managed to program your
      first hardware device using the greatest
      piece of software of today’s world: Node.
    </P>

    <P>
      And remember: What you did is only the beginning of
      what’s possible. Your Starter Kit contains many
      other electronic components like
      servos, LC displays and lots of cables.
    </P>

    <P>
      What I’m trying to say is that the possibilities
      are nearly endless when building things using an Arduino
      and Node. Just go ahead, think of something
      awesome and make it happen! It doesn’t have to be
      something that works completely fine, simply get
      started by letting your hardware dreams come
      true and you’ll learn even more about how these
      things work as time passes.
    </P>

    <H2>Finding Help</H2>

    <P>
      The accessibility of the documentation material is
      one of the key parts of an awesome community. Thankfully, the
      girls and guys who’ve contributed to Johnny Five
      have set up a complete website for the project that
      shows many
