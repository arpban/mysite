    <P>
      It was last year when it happened: Just before Christmas, I’ve
      slowly noticed that I wouldn’t be able to continue working
      at my
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://medienreaktor.de">previous employer</Link>
      . Not only
      have I been rather less satisfied with what I did there, but I simply
      had a lot of side-projects going on as well.
    </P>

    <P>
      I started working there while still attending school. But in
      the end, I knew I either had to stop doing my own stuff to be able to focus
      on working at the agency, or the other way around.
    </P>

    <P>
      The days around that time have been really hard for
      me: Firstly, I didn’t just wanted to let the guys down who offered me
      my first in-house job. Not just that, they’ve even prepared
      themselves for training me. I would have been the first trainee there!
    </P>

    <P>
      So while I still wasn’t sure whether or not this job would
      be the perfect one for me, I had to watch them do all kinds of time-expensive
      things: Finding a proper school for me and training their team
      members for being able to educate me, for example.
    </P>

    <P>
      Then, somewhere in the middle of that, I started feeling the pressure
      of decision on my shoulders. I didn’t knew what the right door was, but
      I definitely knew that I wouldn’t be able to go through both: The effort
      of running a company while working full-time for another one
      is simply too high as that I could have went on with it.
    </P>

    <H2>The Decision</H2>

    <P>
      In the end of December last year, I finally came to the conclusion that I
      rather wanted to run my own business instead of someone else’s.
    </P>

    <P>
      So after letting my bosses know, I’ve packed all of my stuff and
      said “Goodbye”. Not just to a group of people I’ve worked with, but rather
      to a bunch of friends who helped me grow and get better.
    </P>

    <P>
      In the following weeks, I’ve managed to create some really awesome projects
      for my existing clients. But at the same time, I privately
      struggled of not having a fixed schedule anymore: I went to bed very late
      and woke up at the time of lunch.
    </P>

    <P>
      But thankfully, I’ve managed to figure out the things from
      which these kinds of problems spawned from and also how to get rid of them.
    </P>

    <H2>{`December? Why Didn't You Tell Us Earlier?`}</H2>

    <P>
      Because of the things I’ve mentioned above, I wasn’t even sure
      if I wanted to go on with this. So I’ve told myself: Let’s rather
      see how it goes and then go from there.
    </P>

    <P>
      Now, after all of the legal business stuff has been set up
      properly, nearly half a year passed and a few people even offered
      me a chance to work for their own companies, I’m ready.
    </P>

    <P>So what now? Yep, I’m going freelance!</P>

    <P>
      However, you’re also free to call it a “startup”. Because although
      my main income is currently the work for others, I’ve already
      started working on some secret software projects which I’m going
      to release in the future.
    </P>

    <P>
      All in all, my long-term plan is to continue building more
      tools for creatives (like
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://muffin.cafe">muffin</Link>
      ) and finally even
      finance my livelihood from that.
    </P>

    <P>
      But until then, I’m very proud to announce that I’m now officially
      hirable for work on an hourly basis.
    </P>
