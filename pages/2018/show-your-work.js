    <P>
	I finished reading this book called 'show your work' by austin kleon. it's about making your work discoverable and getting discovered. a lot of creative people face this problem, they have a lot of great work done, but no one knows that. 
	</P>
	<P>
	The main thing that i learned from this book is that you have to start using social media. you should see social media as a place to connect with people like yourself, learn from them, share your work, recieve feedback, and contribute to the community. It's very important to contribute to the community what you have to give. 
	slowly start getting into the circles of people like yourselves and learn from them. ask for feedback. don't be ignorant. 
	</P>
	<P>
	Start documenting all your work. keep documenting as you go. you can use social networks or your personal website as a public journal for your projects. start viewing social media as your public project notebook.
	</P>
	<P>
	start including people in the process. people want to know the person behind the work. start sharing daily small things of what you are working on. if you share daily some little bits of what you are working on , what you are learning, things that can be helpful to other people - in long duration these little bits of posts will become something big. 
	</P>
	<P>
	Don't spam. post something that is interesting and will be use to other people. respect the community. 
	You don't have to share everything. If you are uncomfortable with something just don't share.
	</P>
	<P>
	you could only find your voice by speaking ( that is writing ). just write from your heart and dont worry about making mistakes. remember 'So whatttt. who cares.' connect with people. dont be afraid to speak. no one is god. 
	</P>
	<P>
	- ask people for help if you need one. <br />
	- say thank you if you are thankful. <br />
	- share what you learn. share your secrets. more you give, more you get back. <br />
	- when sharing someone else's work, put a proper attribution. <br />
	- share your work. not your food.
	</P>
	<P>
	The writer also talks about being part of the scenius. the great ideas are born by the collective of people thinking and sharing their work and thoughts. i think it is really good idea to think of social media like this.
