    <P>
      Right after quitting
      school, I <Link href="/2016/first-muffin-update">started working</Link> on
      a tiny (but very big for a single person) tool named like
      one of my favourite types of cake:
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://muffin.cafe/">Muffin</Link>
      .
    </P>

    <P>
      It{`'`}s ambition was to be the WordPress of the JavaScript
      world and to provide developers with a
      full <Link href="/2016/second-muffin-update">tool belt</Link> for
      making the creation of new websites and apps as
      easy as a single command.
    </P>

    <P>
      Although I didn{`'`}t really knew much about running JS anywhere
      else then in the browser, as time passed, I discovered
      the various characteristics of the Node ecosystem
      that could make the app truly unique compared with the
      existing solutions. In turn, it gave me a chance to
      solve all kinds of problems with great packages and
      knowledge spread by helpful community members.
    </P>

    <P>
      Today I{`'`}m building all kinds of products with
      JavaScript and Node at one of the most innovate startups on top
      of the industry and I{`'`}m very glad that I had the
      time to figure out all of this valuable knowledge. But it{`'`}s just
      the tip of the iceberg and there{`'`}s still a
      lot left for me to understand.
    </P>

    <P>And that{`'`}s why I{`'`}m writing this article today!</P>

    <P>
      I noticed that creating things for ZEIT not only consumes most
      of my time, but it also often requires me to focus on a
      single big project without getting distracted by small
      things. That{`'`}s just the result of me being handed a lot
      of responsibility and I like it a lot!
    </P>

    <P>
      To make this process easier for me, I completely left Muffin
      out of the equation and it just sat around.
    </P>

    <P>
      I thought I could just continue with it sometime in the
      future, but it honestly looks like this won{`'`}t happen. And because
      I don{`'`}t just want to let all of its fans down without telling them
      why, I decided to write this article.
    </P>

    <P>
      Since all of its parts are licensed under MIT, everyone
      can just fork it and maybe even continue maintaining it. But
      starting today, I personally won{`'`}t write any more code for it.
    </P>

    <P>
      The <Link href="https://github.com/muffin">code</Link> and
      the
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://muffin.cafe/">website</Link>
      {' '}
      will stay online though!
    </P>

    <P>
      Wrapping up this post, I{`'`}d like to thank all people who helped
      me shape the application with useful critique (especially my old
      teams for sharing their experience with me).
    </P>

    <P>Onto a new adventure!</P>
