  When we had our first internal discussion about potentially
  making a conference happen around [ZEIT](https://zeit.co),
  its products and [its community](https://zeit.chat), I got very
  excited and was looking forward to the date. Not just because
  we haven't had one of these before, but also because it would've
  been my first time to meet the team in person.

  Suddenly, it was April the 23th (a week before the conference), I
  packed my clothing and was driven to the Nuremberg
  airport, where I arrived at about 3 am. After checking in
  and eating something (didn't have breakfast), I had to
  say goodbye to my mum and entered the plane:

  The last time I took a flight to a different country was
  about 7 years ago, so I wasn't familiar at all with the
  feeling anymore. However, the first half of the flight was
  pretty easy to handle for me: As the plane got higher and
  higher over the clouds, I tried to focus and keep
  calm, to make my body adapt to the different circumstances with ease.

  But hell, the last few minutes were pure crap. The plane
  changed to descend and it felt like I was loosing the
  ground below my feet. At that time, I slowly started noticing
  that my body wasn't ready at all and my stomach was
  feeling really bad. I quickly grabbed the paper bag at the
  back of the seat in front of me and puked all over it.

  [Noice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8c5wmeOL9o), right? ðŸ˜Œ

  We were already on the runway on the Paris airport, so my
  seatmate quickly opened up his seatbelt and moved over to
  the aisle, while pulling all sorts of handkerchiefs out
  of his bags and handing them to me.

  I felt like pure shit and was laughing at the same
  time. Why? Because I knew that my body was sending me a
  signal and that I had to listen to it. In this case, it
  meant leaving the plane and not entering the one that
  goes to San Francisco. I wanted to stay in Paris and calm
  down before going on with anything else.

  And that's exactly what I did: I left the plane, took
  the exit door in the overpass to the SF plane (Paris
  was my stopover) and then reached the conveyor
  belt for getting my baggage.

  Then it suddenly hit me: I was so dizzy that I completely
  ignored that the baggage will go straight to the
  next plane if the current airport is just a stopover
  for you. "Very nice, Leo... Very. Nice.", I thought.

  Because I knew that the plane to SF would be departing in
  just a few minutes from that time, I got into a rush and
  tried all kinds of ways to tell the airport folks to not
  move my stuff to the next plane (because I wanted to
  stay in Paris). Sadly, none of the special baggage phones
  or computers there helped me, because they were only
  being used for telling the flight provider about
  baggage that got lost.

  While trying to reach someone from their team on one
  of these phones, I placed my boarding card on the table
  next to me (which also had the baggage identification
  on it). Then I got tired of not having achieved anything
  to get my stuff back and left the area with the conveyor belt.

  Outside of that section, I found actual people from the airport
  team and told them about my problem (first class
  folks, because they were the only ones that spoke
  proper english). They got me another special black
  phone which I used to directly call someone from
  the "behind the scenes" guys and it took me a long time
  to explain who I was and what my baggage was. Why? Because
  I left the fucking boarding card in the other room.

  GOTDAMMIT, LEO! ðŸ¤¦

  Thankfully, they've been very helpful and easy to
  handle, so we somehow managed to find my stuff only based
  on the information that I had in my mind. Once the
  conversation was over, my baggage was placed in
  terminal 2F. So I thought, the only thing left to do was
  to quickly walk over to it and get my clothing
  back. But no! Terminal 2F was about 20 minutes away from
  where I landed, because I had to take the bus, which
  also stopped at another terminal.

  Once I finally arrived there, I wasn't able to straight
  to the conveyor belt for the baggage, because the
  doors were only one-way, of course. So I spent another
  30 minutes talking to security people, who I
  explained my situation to and who then opened a special
  door for me, so that I could get to my stuff.

  I looked at the luggage belt and waited. Nothing! I
  waited even longer. Still nothing! Finally I got
  pissed off and talked to some more first class support
  people, who then finally managed to get suitcase
  out onto the luggage belt after another 20 minutes of waiting.

  Who would have thought that getting out of a stopover
  would be so hard? Well, that was it. I didn't want to
  visit Paris anymore, I just wanted to go back
  home and write code in peace. Therefore, my next
  step was to get a train ticket to my hometown
  Bamberg (in Bavaria), which costed a whole lotta money.

  It also took me about half an hour to even get that
  ticket, because I firstly tried the information centre, where
  I was standing in line, just to be told that the
  fucking printer doesn't work anymore.

  But thankfully, they had a special shop in place which
  was designed specifically for getting such
  tickets, so that's where I finally bought them:

  ${<Image src="/static/essays/2017/zeit-day-april/tickets.png" width="380" />}

  Then I waited for about 4 hours: I called my
  mum, answered a few Slack messages, and even pushed
  Now Desktop forward. All despite the fact that I was
  completely dizzy from the flight. When the
  train ultimately came, I dropped into my seat like I was
  about to take a endless sleep.

  I was so tired, but happy to finally get back home!

  Hours over hours passed while I was facing into the
  opposite direction to where the train was going. All
  of this waiting while moving at about 300 km/h
  while sitting wrong (I always need to face into the
  direction of travel), made me even more dizzy and
  my head started feeling really heavy until I
  couldn't stand it anymore: I took the next exit and
  left the train in Brussels, Belgium.

  > Ok. Calm down, Leo. Get some fresh air!
  >
  > Also... What the hell are you doing in Brussels? 600 km away
  from home?! It's getting pretty late, man!

  After I ate something a tiny shop, I left the train station
  thinking that I could potentially get a taxi to drive
  me closer to my hometown, so that my mum could pick me
  up (being in a car is much more comfortable when
  you're feeling dizzy than being in in a train that's
  going 300 km/h, because you can stop whenever you
  want and eventually even make little pauses at
  restaurants to eat and drink something).

  I was immediately approached my a rather old man, who asked
  me if I was looking for a taxi. I was, so I followed him.

  Firstly, everything felt normal. But when the taxi cars showed
  up, we were walking into a completely different direction. I
  asked him where his taxi was and he pointed at a dented, big
  and grey car parking in a thin street.

  I instantly got suspicious and asked him for his taxi
  driver license. He showed me a simple receipt form
  with the word "Taxi driving" and his phone number on
  the top, which - of course - had nothing to do
  with an actual license.

  After that, I started walking away from him, trying
  to get to a real taxi. He kept following me asking where
  I wanted to go to, but once I told him where I was
  living, he suddenly got pretty quiet. Why? Because real
  taxis drive you as far as you want them to (at
  least in most countries I know), fakes ones fail
  after a few kilometres, because it's too heavy job for them.

  Despite him shouting and pointing at other cars that were
  also fake taxis, I managed to get into a real one (a
  big van), where I then explained the driver my situation
  and where I wanted to go to. It took me ages to get
  it through, because he was very churned. Looking at the
  stuff that was laying in the front of his car, I
  also felt like he was doing drugs (which led to him
  being so nervous all the time).

  The taxi had already gained momentum, so I just told him
  to get me as far as possible to my hometown (still 600 kilometres
  away from that point).

  However, after rushing through Brussels' streets and
  mountains with his car (he wasn't driving responsible
  at all and constantly shouting stuff and calling
  people, shouting at them and so on), I started getting
  doubts. Should I really trust this guy with my life? He
  might as well drive me to somewhere else or do whatever
  the hell with my baggage.

  So I lied to him and told him that a friend would pick
  me up and the train station (that's where we
  left), because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. He
  took a lot of detours and eventually managed to get
  back on the way to where we came from.

  While we were driving, I started getting that bad feeling
  in stomach again (because he was going so reckless at
  full speed), so I asked him for a paper bag. But I
  couldn't even manage to get the message through, because
  I started choking on the word, which was why I made hand signs.

  One thing led to another and I puked all over his taxi. I
  kinda managed to pull down the window, so I also puked
  the whole side of the big van (although I was aiming away
  from the car, it felt like it went all directly on it).

  He pulled over to the side on the highway, walked over
  to my side of the car and looked at it with a really
  nice look (I think he was pretty angry). Then he started
  shouting really weird things and pulled an ass full
  of paper handkerchiefs out of his trousers, before
  handing them to me through the window.

  Once he got back into the car, we drove over to the train
  station, where he dropped me off at the exact same
  position where we started from. I gave him
  30â‚¬ more (rounded the price up to 100â‚¬) so that could
  clean his car and refrain from sending out his cousins to
  kick my ass or whatever.

  Anyway.

  I knew I had to call someone to pick me up in Brussels
  or maybe even spend a night there, because it was
  getting very late. Therefore I tried to find a hotel
  where I could spend a few hours without getting
  fooled by criminals. I wandered through the city
  near the train station and I couldn't find a
  single one suggested by Siri that wasn't looking suspicious.

  ![The hotel](/static/essays/2017/zeit-day-april/hotel.png)

  But then, finally, I noticed that the train station had
  a build-in 4-star hotel! "Hell yeah", I thought. I
  placed my baggage there and asked the team if I
  could stay for a few hours, before I called my mum and
  asked her if she could get me. However, she wasn't
  very enthusiastic about that (of
  course, she would have to drive to Brussels, which
  would take about 5-6 hours). I tried to convince
  her with several techniques, but it simply didn't
  work. I had to book a night!

  In the hotel room, I threw all of my stuff on the ground, took
  a warm bath and immediately went to bed (I was so
  tired, I even left all of the lights on - they
  were on the whole night).

  Then, on the next morning, I booked yet another train
  ticket to a city close to my hometown (because I wanted
  to travel with train as less as possible, since
  I still felt very dizzy). I got on the train and picked
  the only seat that was facing into the direction
  of travel: One reserved for disabled people (I waited
  until the train gained momentum, of course, before
  choosing that seat - it was free).

  ![Frankfurt](/static/essays/2017/zeit-day-april/frankfurt.png)

  Just a few hours later, I arrived in Frankfurt, where I was
  supposed to get on another train to Bavaria. However, the
  guy who booked my ticket in Brussels chose the next train
  from a different train station in Frankfurt (the train was
  starting at the main station, but I arrived at the
  airport station). Since that was a mistake (not enough
  time to get to the other one), I had to buy YET
  ANOTHER train ticket. I even paid 4,50â‚¬ (what the
  hell?) for a simple bun with salmon on it.

  I was so happy when I finally arrived in Bavaria, where my mother
  picked me up. We drove home and I went back on my MacBook
  to continue writing code. After that, I got a lot of sleep.

  Hell, those were shitty days! But that doesn't matter
  too much, since I'm back again and healthy. I just
  thought it would be funny to share this story with you, so
  that you can understand why I didn't make it to
  the conference this time.

  I'll just leave this one thing here: There will
  be another [ZEIT Day](https://zeit.co/day) soon - and I'll
  be there, no doubt! ðŸ˜œ
