      Over the last few years, the company I{`'`}m talking about
      didn{`'`}t contribute much when it comes to pushing the web
      forward (at least as far as I know). Their web browser
      {' '}
      {`"`}
      Safari
      {`"`}
      {' '}
      indeed
      got a new look on OS X Yosemite, but they didn{`'`}t change
      much regarding web standard support or even new features for developers.
    </P>

    <P>
      While other browsers like Chrome or Firefox quickly introduced
      many new technologies, Safari kept being stuck in the same place. Part
      of the reason for this is probably the slow release-cycle
      which only comes into play when a new OS update is released. We, as
      developers, we{`'`}re facing an app which wasn{`'`}t able to keep up
      with the new stuff. However, many of us wanted to use it
      because it{`'`}s just so beatifully integrated into Apple{`'`}s other
      products (bookmarks, read-later-articles and RSS-feeds are
      simply synced via iCloud and therefore available on all devices). I
      also think you
      {`'`}
      ll agree with me when I say that it just looks gorgeous.
    </P>

    <P>
      Since Safari is pre-installed on OS X as well as on iOS, you
      might assume that the number of people who are actually using it
      in their everyday life is very
      huge; but it
      {`'`}
      s
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">
        not like that
      </Link>
      . And
      why? Well, even regular users started noticing that other browsers
      like the one from Google provide them with a more convenient way
      of browsing. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, it{`'`}s fast
      as hell. Secondly, it{`'`}s available on multiple platforms
      which opens it up for a wider audience. And thirdly, there
      are much more extensions for it available.
    </P>

    <P>
      And please, also don{`'`}t forget about the effort that Google made
      to promote it
      {`'`}
      s browser. As you might still know, they
      {`'`}
      ve created hundreds
      of different ads and scattered them all over the web - they even
      bought space for
      their
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://youtu.be/N8gvf60RWgw">TV ads</Link>
      . But now, after many
      years, I feel like Apple finally decided to pay more attention to
      the whole web thing. They{`'`}ve announced the support for many
      new web-technologies like unprefixed CSS 3 properties and
      ECMAScript 6 contents. Besides that, they even re-designed the web
      inspector and added a some new Force Touch Events to support
      the whole functionality of the new Trackpad. â€” Not to mention
      that they{`'`}ll even open source Swift<Ref id="1" />.
    </P>

    <P>
      And no, that wasn
      {`'`}
      t even the full list of things they
      {`'`}
      ve implemented
      in Safari 9. I came to the decision that explaining them all in full
      detail wouldn{`'`}t be wort it since Apple already created a
      neat documentation for all implementations. If that{`'`}s not
      enough for you, I recommend
      watching
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=501">
        the video
      </Link>
      {' '}
      of
      the last conference about this topic.
    </P>

    <P>
      While I{`'`}m very happy about this huge step into the right
      direction, I also hope that they won{`'`}t stop here and let Safari fall
      asleep a second time. They really need to make sure to keep up
      with all the stuff that is happening around them if they
      want to compete against others in this scene.
    </P>

    <P>Let{`'`}s hope the best!</P>

    <FootNotes>
      <Note id="1">
        Some people said that Apple might use it
        to create a self-made alternative to JavaScript (since it{`'`}s now
        open-source and the Syntax not differs that much
        from JS). But if you ask me, that will probably never happen. So
        many people out there contributed so much to
        the growth of JS, it{`'`}s very unlikely that a single company could
        replace it with something that was initially created to
        be a compiled language.
