    <P>
      I’m not a “Well, they might fix it in the future” kind
      of a person. If my process of interaction
      with a specific product is being interrupted by some
      nasty bug or a missing feature, I will make
      sure to let the creator know about this — no matter
      if it’s made by a single person or a
      company like Apple (I still believe that the folks
      over there will take their time to read
      it and sometimes even write back).
    </P>

    <P>
      And what I really like is, that many companies
      and independent creatives actually encourage
      this behaviour of mine by providing me with easy ways
      to contact them if I need help or want to provide feedback.
    </P>

    <P>
      However, there are still enough projects out
      there who’s creators don’t spend much time thinking about
      how they can leverage the user’s experience
      and make him believe in the value of his feedback.
    </P>

    <P>
      If you ask me, they’re just cutting themselves
      with this kind of not-giving-a-shit-behaviour. I mean, they
      could definitely use the user’s ideas to save
      time and therefore also money. They can make the
      product better without needing to think about how to do so.
    </P>

    <H2>Common Mistakes</H2>

    <P>
      Firstly, let’s start off with the way the user
      needs to go to contact the makers. Most companies are offering
      multiple contacting ways like e-mail, social
      networks or live-chats (and some even a hotline
      with 30 minutes waiting time). Among those methods, there’s
      also the well-known contact form. You’re basically
      forced to provide pre-defined amounts of information
      which will then mostly just be converted into
      a freaking email reaching the creator, in turn.
    </P>

    <P>Why? Really — why?</P>

    <P>
      <b>I know why.</b> You’re basically afraid that the
      user is too dumb to provide the necessary amount of information
      (or you just like generating extra effort for
      your fellow developers, which will need to code
      the “Drop us a message” page), right? Okay, then
      you’re at least caring about this process a bit.
    </P>

    <P>
      But not enough! Just think about it, there’s always
      some information left. You can’t cover all
      scenarios by simply forcing the user to think about which
      category is the most fitting one for his problem
      and then allowing him to choose it from a
      select-element (as an example).
    </P>

    <P>
      You need to leave him space for creativity. You need
      to allow him to use his own ways of explaining
      to show you what he’s missing or where he needs help from
      you. You need to let him digress from the
      explanation of his initial problem to maybe also
      think about a possible solution by himself, too. And
      yes; I AM looking on you, products with only
      this one contacting-method.
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>
      I already mentioned the first one in the
      paragraphs above: e-mail. Why even bother setting up a
      contact form if the user is able to send out
      mails directly from his own mail-client? Therefore, he
      would be able to keep track of his sent
      messages and easily follow the conversations.
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        <b>Allow the user to follow up:</b> You might see
        this as a naturalness, but I’ve experienced
        many cases in which the UI forced me to write
        my feedback or support question over a
        pre-defined contact form. And the best
        thing: After I had received the answer, it didn’t
        even contain the text I had initially sent. How
        the fuck should I know what I sent days
        ago? Exactly! I guess I’m not the only person
        who’s sending much more than just one
        message each day — please make sure to provide
        the user with the question he had asked
        before (just add it as quotation to the end
        of the mail, for example).
      </LI>

      <LI>
        <b>One conversation for each question:</b> I know this
        might sound stupid, but there definitely
        are companies out there which are using some
        really neat ticketing-systems that are basically
        opening a new e-mail-conversation for each
        answer. What the heck? Just use the exact same
        thread the user wrote from to answer back.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        <P>
          <b>Don’t repeat yourself:</b> I’m talking about
          information which has already been shown
          once — don’t waste space and use the same text
          again. A great example for this is the
          mail I recently automatically received
          from <Link href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</Link> because
          my test for the premium package has expired:
        </P>

        <Image src="/static/essays/2015/support/codepen.png" />

        <P>
          Why did they add the “CodePen” lettering to
          the subject line? It’s already the content
          of the “sender” meta-item. Just leave it out, thanks!
        </P>
      </LI>

      <LI>
        <b>You don’t need 30-line-long signatures:</b> I know
        you want to provide the user with all
        details about your company — but stop it, you
        don’t need to! The fact that the user
        already contacted you over e-mail means that
        he doesn’t need to know your freaking
        hotline-number or postal address (and even if he
        wants those, he just needs to open your
        website). Just be a bit more personal and use
        signatures which simply contain the name of
        the support staff who wrote the answer. For
        example: Cheers, Scott — Thats it! You
        don’t need more.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      As I already said, please don’t force the user to
      write with you over your damn platform. He should be able
      to follow up whenever he wants to and
      shouldn’t need to log into your site to do so
      first. Just make use of things like Facebook, Twitter and the
      good-ol’

      .
    </P>

    <P>
      Every single one of your users writes messages to
      multiple completely different services and I don’t think he
      wants to have all those messages scattered
      around different platforms (at least I personally
      don’t think that’s purposeful in any way). Take
      your time and make sending feedback and support
      questions more comfortable! You’ll quickly see
      that more users are spending their extremely
      valuable time to make your product better, because
      they want to be able to use it without disorders.
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>
      Regarding the “one conversation for each
      question” argument: Please also make sure to not force
      the user to proceed with the dialogue over a
      completely different medium. The conversation should
      be started and finished in one
      stream (or “thread” if that makes more sense to you).
    </P>

    <P>
      For example, if a user reports a bug over
      Twitter, don’t advise him to fill out a
      freaking bug report. That just makes the user’s effort
      on getting the feedback to you redundant. — If you’re out
      of luck, he might even loose the
      incentive of writing you once again completely.
    </P>

    <P>
      When allowing users to write their feedback
      or questions via e-mail, the sender of the response
      should be set to your company’s name (or
      something similar). I saw a few bad examples
      like the following one, who basically set it to the
      real name of the guy who wrote me back:
    </P>

    <Image src="/static/essays/2015/support/github.png" />

    <P>
      Now every time the user opens the mail app, it
      auto-completes the content of
      the “receiver”-field as soon as he starts typing in
      the company’s address. And no — even if he
      tries to remove this information, most apps
      will make sure that it stays.
    </P>

    <P>
      And technically, this info isn’t useful
      at all. I mean, if you have more than 1 single
      support staff, the user won’t write with Scott
      each time. He might also write with <i>Ann</i> or <i>Jacob</i>, since
      they use the exact same address to stay
      in contact with customers — therefore the name
      is pretty useless in this context.
    </P>

    <P>
      Yep. I do know that you can turn this off, but
      many apps have this option enabled by default. And
      if something is enabled by default, it’s very
      likely to not be disabled yet by the “average user”.
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>
      All in all, simply be careful when setting
      up your new company’s customer relationship mechanisms.
