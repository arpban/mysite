      The two big Ds<Ref id="1" /> in the
      world{`'`}s most used connection-network. Completely
      different topics, but still one thing in the end. To me, it
      feels like the number of people who are doing development as
      well as design simultaneously is increasing
      rapidly. <b>
        Nobody wants to just be really good at one thing
        instead of being so-so great on two domains.
      </b>

      When I ask them why, they mostly tell me that it{`'`}s good to know
      about development when you{`'`}re designing something, for
      example (or the other way around). Because then, you
      can shape the idea so that it{`'`}s easy to realize it
      with code - and I agree with them. I would also like
      to design more of my projects and while I learn from
      other people, I keep getting better in doing so.

    <P>
      But I also noticed a bad aspect of the whole scenario: When I
      get an idea and I think it{`'`}s a great one, I often try
      to sketch something up and then make a screen-design out of it. The
      only problem with this approach is that while I try to
      design, my brain tries to shape the idea until it fits my development
      experiences & the knowledge I had at this time. It
      feels like my subconscious mind just cuts some parts off the initial idea.
    </P>

    <P>
      While talking about new projects and ideas with other
      people, I noticed that they{`'`}re also affected by this scenario. And I
      think many other people who work in two different topics also
      apply this way of thinking while making up an idea. So, what
      is this article for? Well, I just want you to be in the know about that.
    </P>

    <P>
      Please don{`'`}t let the limits we{`'`}re currently facing (in the
      development-area for example) or the borders of your experience
      cut off parts of your wonderful idea, it needs to fucking
      see the light of day
      {' '}
      <mark>without getting adapted</mark>
      {' '}
      to existing ones!
