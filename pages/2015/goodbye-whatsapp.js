    <P>
      More than 5 years have passed since WhatsApp saw the light
      of day for the first time. Now it was even acquired by
      the biggest social network out there: Facebook. But in
      my opinion, the acquisition wasn{`'`}t really useful. They
      did little or nothing to make progress and make the app
      better than it was.

    <P>
      Okay, they changed the interface a bit and added some
      tiny new features. But the really big things like an API for
      developers or even just another app for OS X or Windows never
      entered the conversation. To me, it feels like Facebook
      just doesn{`'`}t give a shit about the app. Maybe they just bought
      it because they wanted its user-data...
    </P>

    <P>
      In my view, this had the consequence that WhatsApp now isn{`'`}t able
      to compete with all the other IM-Messengers out there
      anymore, there are many services that have well-documented
      APIs (like <Link href="http://telegram.org">Telegram</Link>) and
      much better interfaces, as well as native applications for
      desktop and also web instances (WhatsApp lately also
      got a shiny web-version, but it{`'`}s not even working for all platforms).
    </P>

    <P>
      That means to me: In the next days I{`'`}ll stop using this stupid app
      and I{`'`}ll also recommend my friends to use a
      different kind of messenger.

    <P>Sorry, Facebook!</P>
