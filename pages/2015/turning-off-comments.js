    <P>
      Since I started this blog using Jekyll, I knew this
      day would come. And yeah, here it is! Because this
      is a static site, there{`'`}s no way to implement a neat
      commenting system without doing many things
      client-side. Since I thought allowing people to share
      their knowledge on my site was a good
      thing, I{`'`}ve embedded Disqus - a really convenient
      way to manage comments.
    </P>

    <P>
      But over time, I noticed a few things that bugged me
      on this constellation and I never felt really happy
      about the solution I put up for this problem. Thus
      there{`'`}s now time for a change:
    </P>

    <P>
      It{`'`}s not just about the time I{`'`}ve spend with
      moderating all those comments (that{`'`}s probably
      what you were thinking of, when you first saw
      the headline). Currently, I don{`'`}t need to use much
      of my time for this. But when looking at some other
      edges of this topic, you{`'`}ll quickly notice that
      removing comments from my site is way better than keeping them.
    </P>

    <H2>Your Time Is Valued</H2>

    <P>
      Right now, there{`'`}s so much stuff happening on the web. And
      I know that I{`'`}m definitely not the only person
      you{`'`}re drawing attention to, which is why I don{`'`}t want
      to artificially encourage you to spent more time
      on a specific text if you actually want to move on
      and read the next one (or even leave my site).
    </P>

    <P>
      After finishing an article, you shouldn{`'`}t be distracted
      with the decision wether to continue scrolling down and
      reading all of those comments or to just leave the page or
      read another article. I want to give people the chance
      to keep up with all the ideas and tips that I{`'`}m putting
      up here to make their work easier and more fun.
    </P>

    <P>... Instead of wasting their time for no reason.</P>

    <H2>The Faster, the Better</H2>

    <P>
      Let{`'`}s face it: Disqus is a performance-disaster. I only
      need a simple list of comments including a text
      field which allows people to easily add their own
      opinion. But that{`'`}s not what I got and also not what
      I will ever get if I keep using this service.
    </P>

    <P>
      I don{`'`}t exactly know why they don{`'`}t care that much about
      speed, but maybe it has something to do with their own
      expectations: Maybe they just want to provide a
      convenient way for visitors to leave a comment. But if
      you ask me, loading ca. <b>
        21 uncached scripts, icon-fonts, images
        and stylesheets
      </b> (which all together make around
      253KB) + building a websocket-connection is just too much<Ref id="1" />.
    </P>

    <P>
      Although they{`'`}re loading so much stuff for just one
      tool, they didn{`'`}t even manage to have the commenting input
      resized when the user switches to landscape-mode on mobile devices.
    </P>

    <P>
      Especially as a defender of the open and
      fast web, I simply can{`'`}t affort this amount of
      garbage on my site. If I speak or write about
      something, I want to be able to account for it.
    </P>

    <H2>How Disqus Makes Money</H2>

    <P>
      When I first started using the service, I kept searching
      for something like a
      {' '}
      {`"`}
      premium
      {`"`}
      {' '}
      or
      {' '}
      {`"`}
      pro
      {`"`}
      {' '}
      package, because I wanted
      to hide this damn branding at the bottom of the
      iframe (which itself is another argument for removing the system).
    </P>

    <P>
      But sadly, I didn{`'`}t find one. Now, a few months
      later, I found out that Disqus did so once, but basically
      doesn{`'`}t do it like this anyway. They{`'`}re now providing a
      VIP service targeted at very large sites like Fox, IGN, etc. - but do
      you really think this could pay all the
      stuff they need to run it? No.
    </P>

    <P>
      I trust them when they say the following in
      their <Link href="http://bit.ly/2jcFuwV">Privacy Policy</Link>:
    </P>

    <Quote>
      We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable
      Information to third parties outside Disqus and its controlled
      subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent...
    </Quote>

    <P>
      But that doesn{`'`}t mean they won{`'`}t use the tracking data
      within their own company to generate targeted ads and
      show them on your site, if you integrate their service. And
      I figured out that this is something that I
      can{`'`}t allow on my site anymore.
    </P>

    <P>
      And while we{`'`}re on it: Yes, I use Google Analytics to
      monitor my site and find out which pages take too much
      time to load (and also on which device and browser). But I
      will probably also remove this service from my site in
      the future, as soon as I find out about another app
      which does the same while agreeing to not use the
      visitors data for creating targeted ads.
    </P>

    <P>
      I also contacted GitHub a while ago and asked them to
      implement a tiny analytics tool for GitHub pages within
      the already existing tool for tracking visitors which
      you get on repos (let{`'`}s hope they will soon spin
      this something like this up).
    </P>

    <H2>How Does the Future Look Like?</H2>

    <P>
      Firstly, I usually post my articles
      on <Link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</Link>, as
      well as on
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.designernews.co/">Designer News</Link>
      {' '}
      (and
      if I don{`'`}t do it, you{`'`}re of course free to do so). If
      you don{`'`}t know them already: They{`'`}re platforms which you
      can also use to add your own thoughts on a specific post
      of mine (e.g. on this one). Of course, you can also
      just write me on Twitter or via e-mail.
    </P>

    <P>
      Using this method, I also make sure that people are not
      confronted with the question if they should post their
      comment on the platform which led them to the article or
      on my site. I{`'`}m really looking forward to the release of
      Apple{`'`}s {`"`}News{`"`} app, maybe they will already provide
      a more convenient solution for this. And while we{`'`}re on
      it: If you already downloaded the beta of iOS 9, try
      searching for {`"`}Leo{`"`} within the News app ðŸ˜… - and let
      me know if you found me (I{`'`}m unfortunately not yet
      able to register for Apple{`'`}s new developer program
      to get the beta by myself, at least their site tells me this).
    </P>

    <P>
      Another great way to make room for your opinion is to simply
      quote the article on your own site and then let me know
      about it over social networks. If I encounter a great
      comment, I will make sure to publish it
      here (including my own statement).
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>
      One of the great people who inspired me to do this is John
      Gruber from Daring Fireball. He also had a few of the thoughts
      I wrote about above and
      already
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://shawnblanc.net/2007/07/why-daring-fireball-is-comment-free/">
        disabled
      </Link>
      {' '}
      them
      many years ago.
    </P>

    <P>
      I hope you{`'`}re not that disappointed about the fact that you
      wont be able to leave comments directly on my site anymore, but
      this is a step I definitely need to make. I also still value
      your opinion, only the way how you can interact with me changed, nothing else.
    </P>

    <FootNotes>
      <Note id="1">
        I know that many of them are only loaded after
        the site itself has finished loading completely, but for
        me, the difference that this fact actually makes, is fairly small.
