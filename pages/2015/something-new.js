      Finally! It{`'`}s been a while since I{`'`}ve blogged properly
      the last time, probably a few years. Why? Well, during this
      time many things changed for me: After I
      left <Link href="http://cuttingegg.de">Cutting Egg</Link> a
      year ago, I started working in a  advertising
      agency called
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.medienreaktor.de">medienreaktor</Link>
      {' '}
      in addition to
      school (where I{`'`}ll also graduate in a few months). I{`'`}m glad to
      finally get a solid reward for making great websites
      and -apps. Of course, the local cooperation with other people
      interested in my field also helps me to expand my knowledge.
    </P>

      Meanwhile, about 5-6 years have passed since I started
      disassembling random websites to get to know how they work
      on the dark side of the web (<i>hihi</i>, {`'dark side'`} - sounds
      scary ðŸ‘»). I{`'`}m happy that I{`'`}m now able to make websites for
      people who like my work and want to support me and I really like
      doing it - of course, it{`'`}s sometimes at bit exhausting, but
      I think for the long haul, it{`'`}s perfect for me.

      But that{`'`}s just the beginning. After school, I{`'`}ll probably
      do an apprenticeship for a couple of years to get to
      know more people in this scene. I also might build some of the
      ideas that I{`'`}ve sketched in my notebook as I{`'`}ll hopefully
      have more time for things like that. This is where my
      blog comes in: I{`'`}d like to build some <b>more connections</b> over
      the web and I{`'`}ll of course also write some more posts
      about handling things the right way & my maybe also about
      my second love: HipHop.
