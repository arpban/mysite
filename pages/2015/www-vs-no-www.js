    <P>
      When it comes to the elder of all subdomains, the
      minds of many developers often divide into
      two different bases:
    </P>

    <P>
      One, which is constantly jeering and wanting to
      completely remove the three letters because of aesthetic
      reasons - and the other, which is still worried
      about all the disadvantages the change could have
      on the web’s infrastructure.
    </P>

    <P>
      <b>But which one should you listen to?</b> - Well, to
      be honest, I wont be able to provide you with a
      solution that’s the right in any case. BUTT I can show
      you how to decide, which way is the best for
      your kind of project...
    </P>

    <H2>Who Should Use WWW</H2>

    <P>
      Many system administrators will advise you to not support the
      deprecation of the {`"`}www{`"`} prefix. The reason behind that is, that
      it will allow your host to forward visitors to another server
      if the current one is on fire. To do that, they need to be
      able to update the DNS records of your domain (which is done
      using CNAME entries). Unfortunately, using this procedure
      is not possible without the <i>www</i>.
    </P>

    <P>
      But don{`'`}t worry, if your site doesn{`''`}t get tons of traffic
      each day, this isn{`'`}t something you need to worry about. Mostly
      people who are using cloud application providers
      like
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</Link>
      {' '}
      are affected by this.
    </P>

    <P>
      Another tiny weak spot on the big balloon that represents all
      developers fighting for the abolition of <i>www</i> is definitely, that it
      if you set up a cookie for a domain like {`"`}www.mysite.org{`"`}, the
      browser won{`'`}t sent it out when accessing content on subdomains
      like
      {' '}
      {`"`}
      dumb.mysite.org
      {`"`}
      . But if don
      {`'`}
      t use the
      {' '}
      <i>www</i>
      {' '}
      on your
      main domain, the cookie will be shared on all connections to all subdomains.
    </P>

    <H2>{`Who Shouldn't Use WWW`}</H2>

    <P>
      People with small sites. Better described as simple websites
      providing information instead of huge web-apps visited by
      thousands of people each day.
    </P>

    <P>
      Removing the prefix from their domain will definitely make
      them look better - especially on all those dumb business posters
      potential customers will see on the streets.
    </P>

    <P>
      If we{`'`}re currently talking about a really huge
      business - I mean, really huge (like McDonalds) - who is putting
      it{`'`}s address on every fucking print, this might also
      save a large amount of ink and therefore
      also ink<Ref id="1" /> - you{`'`}re
      welcome, environment!
    </P>

    <H2>So, How Can I Support No-WWW?</H2>

    <P>
      To really make a difference, you just need to forward the
      traffic on your domain from „www.“ to the URL without the three letters.
    </P>

    <P>
      For example, you can do that by adding a
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>.htaccess</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      file with the
      following contents to the root directory of your site:
    </P>

    <Code language="apache" syntax={apache}>
      {`RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.(.+)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,L]`}
    </Code>

    <P>
      Redirecting all visitors from the old subdomain to the main
      adress will let them know that they don’t need those
      three „w“s at the beginning at stop using them.
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>
      Okay, we{`'`}re finished! Now take a look at your
      project and make the best possible descision.
    </P>

    <P>
      All in all I nevertheless think that YOU (if you don’t have a site
      that gets hundreds of thousands of visitors each day) should
      start deprecating the subdomain <b>today</b>, so that the
      webhosters will respond to this issue with a better solution in the future.
    </P>
