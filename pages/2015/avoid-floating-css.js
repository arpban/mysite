      Do we still need to use it? Yes, the
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>float</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      property
      has been here for a really long time. I guess most
      of us used it for galleries, navigations
      and maybe also grids. But let{`'`}s be honest with
      ourselves, it{`'`}s a very uncomfortable way to
      align items one-after-another.
    </P>

    <P>
      Firstly, there{`'`}s this whole problem that the parent element
      of the aligned items will break down like an old house that
      {`'`}
      s currently
      being demolished by a demolition crane. <i>
        Okay, I{`'`}m digressing a bit, let{`'`}s
        move on.
      </i> So why are we still using it? I mean, pushing an inline
      image to the side and letting other
      elements (like paragraphs) flow around it is still
      a great use-case. But it clearly generates to much
      hassle in the end, if you ask me - you need to take
      care of too much other aspects like clearing floats and
      making sure they don{`'`}t affect other elements.
    </P>

    <P>
      The answer is: No, we don{`'`}t need to use this
      method for columns within content-areas anymore, there
      are some other alternatives which are way more
      easy to use and therefore create much less pain while
      developing. Until now, many web-developers
      might have argued with the fact that property-values
      like
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>flex</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      are were badly supported by browsers. But
      this time is over, every major browser
      encourages you to use it now.
    </P>

    <P>
      If you{`'`}re also tired of floating elements and want to
      try out something new, continue reading. If not, you{`'`}re completely
      free to leave this page.
    </P>

    <P>
      Alright gentlemen, then start your engines now! Thanks to
      the cool people who are contributing to the web
      standards, I{`'`}m now able to show you a few other methods
      for aligning items that are much less pain-in-the-ass
      and also way easier to use.
    </P>

    <H2>Flexbox</H2>

    <P>
      Firstly, there{`'`}s <InlineCode>flex</InlineCode> - I told you about
      it earlier. It{`'`}s a convenient manner that allows you to position
      elements with different sizes easily by providing maximum and
      minimum widths or heights for example. It will also bring
      other sub-properties which are able to calculate the size
      of an item in dependence of the other ones around it.
    </P>

    <Quote author="Chris Coyier - CSS Tricks">
      The main idea behind the flex
      layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items
      {`'`}
      {' '}
      width or height
      in order to best fill the available space...
    </Quote>

    <P>
      The problem with our current box model is that we{`'`}re theoretically
      not able to set three elements to the exact same
      width, for example. For this, you would technically need to
      set a width of 33,<span style={overline}>3</span>% for
      each of them (100% divided into 3 columns), and
      it{`'`}s neither possible to set periodical numbers in CSS, nor
      is it useful. Sure, there{`'`}s a practical solution for that:
    </P>

    <P>
      Browsers are built to figure things like this out and close
      the gap between theory & practice. They will always size
      the items until they{`'`}re completely equally of width. But in
      my view, that{`'`}s just a messy solution and not stable for
      the future. And yes, that
      {`'`}
      s where
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>flex</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      comes in.
    </P>

    <P>
      There are a few more things that I especially like on this
      property, everything is less confusing with it. For example, the
      container{`'`}s margins don{`'`}t collapse with the margins
      of its child elements. And even better: The parent element
      doesn{`'`}t suddenly loose it{`'`}s height and the display-order
      of it{`'`}s children is completely independent of their order
      in the source code.
    </P>

    <P>
      To start using this method now, just try it{`'`}s easy syntax
      and add the following to the parent element:
    </P>

    <Code language="css" syntax={css}>
      {`display: -webkit-flex;
display: block;`}
    </Code>

    <P>
      For the first steps, there{`'`}s absolutely no need to add
      attributes to the child items. They will magically start
      reacting to this change and will immediately line up one
      after another. If the content elements of the container
      aren{`'`}t modified in any other way, it will look like this:
    </P>

    <CodePen
      user="mindrun"
      hash="1becc47f9b6b90d3dad30649e061ddbc"
      height="240"
      theme="15948"
    />

    <P>
      But beware, there are many other cool properties
      like <InlineCode>justify-content</InlineCode> (which I also used to
      center the items in this
      preview),
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>align-self</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      and
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>order</InlineCode>
      . If
      you want to learn more about how to exactly use
      them, take a glimpse on
      Mozilla
      {`'`}
      s
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex">
        documentation
      </Link>
      {' '}
      (the
      other related properties are shown on the left there).
    </P>

    <P>
      However, watch out! In the current state of
      art, the <InlineCode>flex</InlineCode> property is supported
      on most browsers (like I already said), but you still need to
      use prefixes when firing it up in Chrome or Safari
      for example. The confusing thing about that is that the main
      property wants you to insert the prefix within the
      value (<InlineCode>-webkit-flex</InlineCode>) and not before
      the key (just take a look on the code example up there). All
      other properties can generally be prefixed as
      usual (e.g. <InlineCode>-webkit-justify-content: center</InlineCode>).
    </P>

    <H2>Blocks, but InlineCode</H2>

    <P>
      Yes, that{`'`}s kind of a weird heading but describes
      exactly what I want to talk about now: The
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>inline-block</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      value
      used in combination with the
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>display</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      property. Sure, you
      might already now about it <i>
        (What am I talking
        about, of course you do...)
      </i>, but have you ever thought
      about using it as an alternative for aligning
      columns? I mean, that{`'`}s the use-case for which you
      perhaps needed floats before, right?
    </P>

    <P>
      Okay then. I will now try to be as direct as possible when
      presenting you the pros and cons of this property. First
      off, we need to talk about whitespace, one of the
      disadvantages of this method:
    </P>

    <P>
      When setting up a portion of clean HTML code, you{`'`}ll probably
      make use of several great indention options to make the code
      easily readable. That means, you{`'`}ll put each child element
      into a new line instead of writing them all successively. And
      that{`'`}s great, please don{`'`}t do it otherwise! However, this
      indention will generate irritating space-characters between
      the elements in the output â€” look here:
    </P>

    <CodePen
      user="mindrun"
      hash="cd4a213638114aea89cbd3137b36bb19"
      height="240"
      theme="15948"
    />

    <P>
      But of course we neither need nor want them to show up. They{`'`}re just
      completely useless when creating columns. To fix this
      issue, we need to set
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>font-size</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      to
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>0</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      or put all items
      in one line within the code. Well, you might have
      already noticed it: That{`'`}s also a hacky solution, isn{`'`}t it? And
      not something that has been covered by the creators of
      this property, so it might also be inappropriate to use
      this value for columns (I guess that{`'`}s were the opinions
      differ. Many people are arguing that this is something
      that can be overlooked without worries, other people
      might say it
      {`'`}
      s clear that it
      {`'`}
      s not the right property for this case).
    </P>

    <P>
      Anyway, don{`'`}t hold yourself back from using it just because it
      needs some more adjustments to work
      properly (this are my 2 cents). We need to use things for
      different purposes other than they have been made for and
      try them out in various scenarios to find out what we{`'`}re in
      need for and to push the web forward.
    </P>

    <P>
      In contrast to flex, the
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>inline-block</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      value doesn
      {`'`}
      t
      provide you with any other cool property which you could
      use to align the items in a special way. However, it allows
      you to treat the content elements like text when it comes
      to positioning (since they{`'`}re displayed inline). For
      example, you can push them into the left or right edge
      or the middle by using <InlineCode>text-align</InlineCode>. You could also
      use properties like
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>line-height</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      to equal the heights
      of all elements inside the container (that also depends
      on if they own padding, since it{`'`}s extending the line-height).
    </P>

    <P>
      I{`'`}m sure the most of you already know everything about this
      value, since it{`'`}s also being used for various other use-cases. But
      if you don{`'`}t, read more about
      it
      {' '}

        here
      </Link>
      {' '}
      (the
      official documentations are not really helpful now, since
      they{`'`}re too abstract for you, I guess).
    </P>

    <H2>Conclusion</H2>

    <P>
      My indention behind this article was clearly not to provide
      you with a complete guide on how to use those properties. It
      was rather a collection of recommondations you could
      use instead of the old floating-method. If I inspired
      you to think about these alternatives, I{`'`}m happy.
    </P>

    <P>
      What you should also remember is that these properties
      have initially been designed to provide easy solutions
      for creating columns within a content-area (at least
      that{`'`}s what I heard from other people and what my
      experiences told me) and not for creating complete layouts (you
      should use <Link href="/2015/css-grid">grids</Link> for this). And
      yes, I{`'`}m talking of the future. Currently, you
      would probably need to use those properties for
      layouting too, because
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>grid</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      isn
      {`'`}
      t fully ready for production yet.
