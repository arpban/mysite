      {`"`}Are you stupid?{`"`} â€” Well, in some cases, I am. In some
      others, I{`'`}m not. But I definitely know that you
      are. Why? Because you{`'`}re asking me such a dumb question.
    </P>

    <P>
      If a person is {`"`}dumb{`"`} or not, depends on the intellect of the
      person who{`'`}s judging. If you ask Elon Musk if Homer Simpson is
      more dumb than him, he will probably answer you with <i>Yes</i>. But if
      you ask a person who{`'`}s more dumb than Homer Simpson (I{`'`}m not
      sure if that{`'`}s even possible), she will definitely answer you
      with <i>No</i> (at least if she{`'`}s being honest). To cut a
      long story short: The state {`"`}dumb{`"`} is relative to the
      judging person{`'`}s intellect. More clearly: If you{`'`}re asking
      a person about being {`"`}dumb{`"`} in a non-rhetorical
      context, you{`'`}re the dumb one.
    </P>

    <P>
      So now tell me, how should I know by myself if I{`'`}m dumb or
      not? Right, I can{`'`}t! I would have to compare
      my own state of intellect with itself. And you should know
      that comparing things with themselves is technically
      not possible. But since you{`'`}ve asked me that
      question, you don{`'`}t. Therefore I{`'`}m free to call you dumb.

    <P>
      If someone asks you if you{`'`}re dumb, you{`'`}re free to use the first
      paragraph as an answer. But beware: If the person who{`'`}s asking
      you is smart enough, she will answer with {`"`}It{`'`}s a
      rhetorical question, you moron.{`"`}
