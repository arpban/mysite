      Since the beginning, Apple has always been a company that
      strives to provide a minimalistic feeling for both developers and
      users when it comes to interfaces. This desire was
      expressed another time when they introduced Safari’s Reader
      functionality with version 5, back in 2010:
    </P>

    <P>
      Today, the tool is used for reading articles without the
      usual amount of distraction on blogs and news sites. Besides
      hiding all styles except the basic text formatting, it also
      removes all kinds of ads, JS-trackers or other useless scam
      that keeps you from focusing on the content.
    </P>

    <P>
      If you’re working with HTML5 (I hope so), you might
      already know that there’s this one tag that is used
      for displaying a line of paragraphs, headings, block
      quotes and lists:
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>{`<article>`}</InlineCode>
      . Although Safari doesn’t require a
      specific tag, it’s currently the most semantic one for this
      purpose. Which means, if your websites shows news items, they
      should be shown in such a tag. If you don’t use it, Safari will
      simply pick the first element that looks the most like an
      article, based on its markup.
    </P>

    <P>
      The only problem with this feature is that it not
      only picks the tags I’ve mentioned, but also things
      like
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>{`<time>`}</InlineCode>
      ,
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>{`<hr>`}</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      or other elements which are semantically
      correct within an <InlineCode>{`<article>`}</InlineCode> tag.
    </P>

    <P>
      But if you’re like me and want to display the date and/or dividers
      below the meta information but don’t want to show them in the
      Reader view, you need to find a way around that. That of
      course also applies to other elements which you only want to show
      on the site and not within the Reader.
    </P>

    <P>
      Sadly, Apple didn’t introduce a custom attribute for hiding
      such elements within Safari’s Reader. But thankfully, it does support
      HTML5. And that in turn means that we can easily
      hide those elements by doing the following:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        Firstly, you need to add the
        attribute
        {' '}
        <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Globale_Attribute/hidden">
          hidden
        </Link>
        {' '}
        to
        all of the elements which you only want
        to show on the site and not within the Reader.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Once you’ve done that, those tags will be hidden both
        on your site and within the Reader. This is the case because
        the browser applies the “display” property
        with the value of “none”.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Now the only thing you need to do is make them visible again
        on the site. And this can simply be done by
        setting those elements’ display property back to “block” (or a
        different value, depending on how you want the
        element to behave).
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      From now on, your visitors are able to enjoy
      a clean reading experience without unnecessary clutter. If you
      want to try this out, just click the button in
      the address-bar that looks like a few lines of
      text grouped together while viewing this post.
    </P>

    <P>
      If you look close, you’ll notice that the web view contains
      a date and a divider line, but the Reader view doesn’t.
    </P>
