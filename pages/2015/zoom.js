      In 2007, Steve Jobs introduced us to the advantages of Apple’s new
      multitouch functionality, which was shipped with the first iPhone. I’m not
      sure if it was already available in Safari back
      then, but we definitely all not that it is now. And fuck, many of us
      are angry about it, right? Because it often breaks our wonderfully crafted web-layouts.
    </P>

    <P>
      Thankfully, Apple later added support for the viewport meta-tag, which is
      now being used on every single responsive site to make the viewport fit
      the screen-width. Without using it, your site looks the same as on huge screens, even
      after adding media queries to your stylesheets.
    </P>

    <P>
      Many of us blindly copied the element from other sites, without thinking
      about what it actually does. The only thing most of us probably noticed in the
      first place, was that it finally looked great on mobile devices. But
      there’s one thing we didn’t realize: By
      setting “maximum-scale” to “1” or “user-scalable” to “no”, we forced the
      browser to disable the pinch-to-zoom functionality of iOS and other operating
      systems completely. In turn, people who weren’t able to read our
      text, simply couldn’t make it readable. We left them alone in the dark.
    </P>

    <P>
      Another reason why some of us set those variables was because Safari
      simply decided to zoom our site in the landscape mode, which
      often looked quite shitty. Until today, I don’t now why the fuck they’re
      doing this. But instead of simply disabling zoom
      completely, I have a better solution for you:
    </P>

    <P>
      Just give your body the following property. It will make sure that
      the font size won’t get automatically adjusted by the system if the user changes to landscape mode. You
      can
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-size-adjust">
        learn more
      </Link>
      {' '}
      about
      why it’s exactly needed and how you can achieve the same on a different mobile OS:
    </P>

    <Code language="css" syntax={css}>{`-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;`}</Code>

    <P>
      After you did that, you just need to also make sure that you
      neither have “maximum-scale” set to “1”, nor “user-scalable” to “no”. In the
      end, it should roughly like this:
    </P>

    <Code language="xml" syntax={xml}>
      {`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no">`}
    </Code>

    <P>
      This just means that we’re ensuring that the viewport has
      the width of the screen as soon as the layout gets rendered. Therefore our
      media queries will work just fine. And the best thing about those
      two changes: If the visitor switches to landscape-mode on his
      device, the design won’t look like it was zoomed in. No, it will simply
      remain as it is — just the width will differ, so more space for content.
    </P>

    <P>
      Yeeeha! You made it! Your users are happy again, since they’re
      able to zoom in if they can’t read something. Great job!
    </P>

    <P>
      And as always, thank your for giving a shit! Also thanks to Leigh McCulloch, whose

      solution to make it work on my own site.
