    <P>
      With computers, we got another big thing
      to worry about in our everyday life: Passwords.
    </P>

    <P>
      Many of us are faced with them daily and try to keep them
      ordered and stored in a safe place. Nevertheless
      the biggest part of all users isn’t giving a single fuck. This
      was part of the reason why a small group of developers decided to
      create a new way for handling those data bits
      using so-called “password managers”.
    </P>

    <P>
      I got upset about this myself a few years ago and decided
      to pay for 1Password on both OS X and iOS. After
      that, I immediately started caring more and more about my
      passwords. But I noticed something else too: I
      spend way more time with them.
    </P>

    <P>
      I started sorting them into groups, adding additional fields
      of information to my “vaults” and began storing things
      like credit cards, bank account data and such too. You won’t
      believe me, but I also got constantly distracted
      by those icons which showed up next to each entry.
    </P>

    <P>
      If a website didn’t add a proper icon for that, I couldn’t help
      myself and wrote them in regards to freaking add one.
    </P>

    <H2>Enough!</H2>

    <P>
      Now I’m done with it, I don’t want to spend any more time
      with passwords. Besides that: it’s 2015. Our software
      should figure out all of that by itself, don’t you think
      so too? So I did it. I went back to where it
      all started: the iCloud keychain.
    </P>

    <P>
      Two days ago, I had lunch with one of my bosses and regarding
      my question if he’s using 1Password for personal
      purposes, he denied and told me about the built-in keychain
      functionality of iCloud. Since I had many bad experiences with it
      until that day, I looked at him like he was
      crazy. I couldn’t really understand it. But then he told me
      about how seamlessly it got integrated into Safari and how
      easy both the creation of new passwords and the
      way of managing them is.
    </P>

    <P>
      On the same day, I decided to give it another try and also
      be up-to-date about what’s happening in this section of
      our industry. And I’m glad I did it. There’s one special thing
      that boils many of my remaining thoughts down to the
      essence: “It’s built to make it seem like there
      are no passwords at all”.
    </P>

    <P>
      I read that on the internet and it’s exactly what
      the iCloud keychain does better compared to 1Password or other
      competitors. Do you really think that a regular user wants
      to spent so much time filling out fields and
      ordering passwords into groups? No! And I also don’t think
      that this is what today’s software should
      do. It should think by itself and always be prepared to
      provide us with our data.
    </P>

    <P>
      And that’s exactly what Apple’s keychain functionality
      does: if you visit a website, the fields are already filled-out and
      the only thing that’s left to be done by the user
      is clicking the submission button. No need for crappy-integrated 1Password
      options. It’s the same with saving passwords: I don’t
      need a third-party extension which pops up every time it
      thinks it’s needed. It just works. All password fields on
      a login form show a little key which I only need to hit once
      to be able to choose or save a password.
    </P>

    <H2>For Developers</H2>

    <P>
      After doing a bit of research, I also found out that Apple
      now officially provides a way for third party app
      developers to access the keychain. As far as I know, the developer
      only needs to verify the ownership of the domain of
      his website and all users will be able to choose the related password directly out of
      a
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://9to5mac.com/2014/06/13/ios-8-lets-apps-access-safari-autofill-credentials-for-quick-easy-login/">
        selection popup
      </Link>
      . So
      easy, try it! I thing right know is the right time to make the change if you’re still
      using a third-party password manager.
    </P>

    <P>
      Just admit it: Apple doesn’t need to be that fast at making
      their software great. Because as soon as they actually
      make significant changes to it, it’s incomparable to
      third-party-apps when it comes to integration. Simply because they’re able
      to adjust the core of iOS like they want it. Of course
      that’s only one part of making great apps (besides the
      design and the actual features), but it this case, it’s the
      most important one.
    </P>

    <P>
      Regular people don’t spend time thinking about ordering
      their passwords. They want it to just work! And that’s the area
      in which we need to improve our products too.
    </P>

    <H2>For Teams</H2>

    <P>Oh.</P>

    <P>
      I forgot to mention that this solution does work
      perfectly for personal use, but teams will definitely have to
      stick to apps like
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://1password.com/teams/">1Password</Link>
      {' '}
      (since your team members
      probably won’t agree to use a single iCloud account).
