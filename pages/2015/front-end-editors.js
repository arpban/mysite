      If youâ€™re on a social network and following some of the
      most known people in the industry, you canâ€™t use excuse that you donâ€™t already
      know of this topic. Every month someone new comes around
      with a supposedly better solution for allowing clients to easily edit
      their websites by themselves, without needing to contact an
      agency and pay a lot of money just to make a small change on the site.
    </P>

    <P>
      I took my time and started looking carefully on how those
      people are building such products and I noticed: Instead of learning
      from each other, they always make the same faults over and over again.
    </P>

    <P>
      Therefore Iâ€™d like to use this post to clear up
      some things for all those of you whoâ€™re planning to go into this
      direction too, since youâ€™d like to enable casual
      people (who are no developers at all) to be independent from
      expensive companies. If you ask me, itâ€™s not a
      bad idea at all. It just needs to be done properly!
    </P>

    <P>
      Then letâ€™s start with some common errors Iâ€™ve recently
      noticed on many of those applications:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        Content isnâ€™t absolute. Itâ€™s relative. If youâ€™re developing
        websites and want to take care of itâ€™s usability, youâ€™ll build
        it mobile first. Which means that the elements on your
        site will react to the size of the screen and show different
        variants of the initial content to be perfectly accessible
        for users on different devices. This in turn means that you
        definitely need to find a way to edit those elements
        in deviant forms.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Elements arenâ€™t always visible and therefore editable. Theyâ€™re hidden
        between sliders, curtains, and other kinds of walls
        of different items or effects. If you want to create a
        productive app that makes editing easier, you either have
        to find a way to show those hidden parts as soon as the
        user wants to edit them (which is very hard since every
        design has a completely different markup for those things) or
        provide a different view for those items, which shows all
        hidden items so that the users can change their contents.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        To break it down: More ease on the aspect of editing on
        the front side also means less possible complexity
        when it comes to the layout. If you want to create a
        useful solution, you need to find a way to maintain
        the complexity of the layout while also making it
        easy to edit (and maybe also move) elements around.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      While developing such things, please take advantage
      of other peoples knowledge. Many of us spend hours of
      thinking about the right process and Iâ€™m sure you donâ€™t
      want to waste time.
    </P>

    <P>
      As I already said, Iâ€™d love to provide clients
      with a front-end editing tool that doesnâ€™t suck
      and Iâ€™m probably going implement one into
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://muffin.cafe">Muffin</Link>
      .
    </P>

    <P>
      But please donâ€™t understand this like an attack on those
      apps. I donâ€™t fear for my job (like many others whoâ€™re writing
      essays like this one do). If they do something, they do it
      for themselves, rather than for the community and therefore
      lack the necessary drive and literally
      only
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://medium.com/@imcatnoone/it-s-called-ship-not-shit-bf5f84d223f9">
        ship shit
      </Link>
      , which
      is also the reason why they need to fear for
      someone else coming around with a better solution.
    </P>

    <P>
      However, all in all, I donâ€™t give a fuck about which
      solution will make the run. As long as it keeps the
      web alive, Iâ€™m happy. But as you can see, thereâ€™s still a lot of work to do! ðŸ‘Š
    </P>

    <P>Otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be hereâ€Šâ€”â€Šthatâ€™s my job.</P>
