    <P>
      As a web developer, Im very concerned about
      performance. I{`'`}ve spent a lot of time finding the right workflow for
      building fast apps (and I still do). My primary wish is
      that a user shouldn{`'`}t have to wait to get what he{`'`}s looking
      for. We{`'`}re the web. And the web is currently the fastest
      and easiest way to get information about a
      certain topic, be entertained or connect with other people
      on the other side of the world.
    </P>

    <P>
      To maintain this, I{`'`}ve tried to find the perfect balance
      between the ease & speed of development and performance. But
      since there{`'`}s no real perfect way to handle
      this, I
      {' '}
      <Link href="/2015/developer-friendliness">ran against a wall</Link>
      {' '}
      very
      often. Over time, all of
      this felt more like a endless philosophical journey
      than a way to the best solution.
    </P>

    <P>
      Now I know that it{`'`}s important to see the big picture instead
      of just small parts. Of course I will still do my best
      to make the website of my clients as fast as possible (every MB counts!), but
      one thing that I will stop doing is trying to
      squeeze out every single byte of my code.
    </P>

    <P>
      As a rookie, the first thing you will now think is probably
      something like {`"`}Oh look! He stopped caring about performance, simply
      because he{`'`}s tired of looking for the best
      possible solution{`"`}. So I will try to explain why it{`'`}s much
      better now than it was before (and not worse).
    </P>

    <P>
      This might sound a bit funny, but for me, it actually has been more
      effort to care less about this than caring more about it. I had to force
      myself to put my hands away from those never-ending stories of
      always wanting to reach the maximum speed and spend more
      time thinking about how to go bigger steps and improve my
      projects in an integral way.
    </P>

    <P>
      Why? Because it{`'`}s 2015. Devices and internet connections are
      getting faster and faster, while we{`'`}re still spending hours of
      hours trying to reach such little goals instead of solving
      the big problems in our world.
    </P>

    <P>
      <b>But beware!</b> I{`'`}m not telling you to stop caring about
      performance. I
      {`'`}
      m just trying to explain why it
      {`'`}
      s better to make big steps.
    </P>

    <P>So I guess there{`'`}s only one thing left to clarify:</P>

    <H2>How I Came to This</H2>

    <P>
      I{`'`}ve spend the last year designing and developing a big web app
      based on <Link href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</Link> (I will
      let you know more about it
      soon). For this reason, I also had to dig really deep into
      the idea behind client-side-rendered apps and separating the
      project into two parts: The app itself (running
      in the browser) and an API server which takes
      in requests and responds with data.
    </P>

    <P>
      At first, I was a bit confused why they{`'`}re doing this and
      why all development tools in this area so opinionated, but
      now I understand and love it!
    </P>

    <P>
      The posts of Tom Dale (co-creator of Ember.js) were very
      helpful on my journey to get there. If you want to dig deeper
      into this, too, I recommend you to
      read

    <P>Here{`'`}s my favorite part:</P>

    <Quote by="Tom Dale">
      So here’s what I think a more interesting
      study would be: what is the execution time of real world apps
      of approximately similar complexity? It may be that apps
      built with frameworks are still slower. But my hypothesis
      is that, for apps of any complexity, the ones that start
      off “vanilla” will accrete their own Frankenframework
      that performs similarly to, if not worse than, an
      off-the-shelf framework like Ember or Angular.
    </Quote>

    <P>
      Of course those big frameworks aren{`'`}t made for the average
      website and in their current state, you should only use them
      for real web apps. But if your project fits this criteria, you
      definitely need to use one of them (Ember.js is my personal recommendation).
    </P>

    <H2>Conclusion</H2>

    <P>
      Don
      {`'`}
      t underestimate the importance of performance in today
      {`'`}
      s web. But
      also don{`'`}t be so stupid to spend all of your valuable time
      on those little tweaks and go make some big steps!
    </P>

    <P>
      Oh. And before I forget it: No, I was
      wrong. Code

      the
