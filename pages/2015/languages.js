      We’re living in a global world. Everybody is
      connected to everyone through the internet and its broad
      variety of products which want you to spend even more time with it.
    </P>

    <P>
      Sure, something like the internet needs standards. There are
      many many people out there contributing to it every day, from thousands
      of countries all over the earth. There is definitely
      a need for a global language which can be understood
      by everyone. And this is English.
    </P>

    <P>
      It’s an easy language — compared to other ones. It’s the
      language on which most programming languages are based on. It’s also outside
      the internet, nearly everybody knows it.
    </P>

    <P>
      While developing products, setting up wikis and GitHub
      repositories, I often came across that one question: Every “creator” on the web
      knows English, so why don’t I just write everything in
      this language? It would be easy for me and well understandable
      by developers and designers.
    </P>

    <P>
      But in my opinion, that’s not how we should deal with this topic. Language
      isn’t just another way how we communicate with other
      individuals around us. It’s also a part of our culture. Century over
      century, human beings formed their speech to easily communicate
      information to other humans. Even if they didn’t do it
      intentionally, they put a huge amount of their livetime into shaping
      each language until it became as easy as it’s today to transmit
      thoughts into other people’s minds using written words or speech.
    </P>

    <P>
      And of course that’s not the end. We’re constantly
      changing the way how we speak and write to fit the
      strain and speed of our everyday life.
    </P>

    <P>
      Every language is beautiful. Currently, there
      are over
      {' '}
      <b>3.500</b>
      {' '}
      languages spoken across the world. And in my view, we should
      keep <b>all of them</b>. As humans — especially designers and
      developers, we often tend to make everything as perfect and easy as possible.
    </P>

    <P>But in this case, that’s not helpful at all.</P>

    <P>
      Of course, it’s easier to just write everything in one
      language: Everyone could then understand it. But with
      this method, we’ll loose a huge part of our culture. And culture
      is what defines us. It’s what we can use to find
      out what we are. Without it, we would all be the same.
    </P>

    <P>
      So don’t support this thinking. You don’t need to translate
      everything into your mother tongue now, but if you have
      enough time, contribute something to human existence and also
      provide another translation in your native language.
    </P>

    <P>Thank you for giving a fuck! 😘</P>
