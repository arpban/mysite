    <P>
      When I heard of that whole conference movement a while
      ago, I was firstly a bit confused about why some people
      are spending their time organizing events on which all
      kinds of folks from the internet meet together and talk
      with each other. Every time someone from those big players
      in our industry decided to post a picture of himself
      sitting within the crowd of such a conference, I
      simply couldn{`'`}t understand it. We{`'`}re the internet. If
      we want to talk with people, it doesn{`'`}t
      matter if they{`'`}re on the back side of the world,
      we just need to hit a button and we{`'`}re immediately
      able to both hear and see each other and discuss
      whatever the fuck we would like to discuss.
    </P>

    <P>
      But when I got older, I realized that this way
      of communicating can{`'`}t be compared to the
      way how people deal with each other on those events. It
      also feels much less forced and freer. There are
      no connection losses or bad interfaces in
      between, just a nice bunch of people talking
      about their favorite topic.
    </P>

    <P>
      Since I{`'`}m just a human and therefore much
      more of a fan of this than chatting with someone over
      the internet, I decided that I have to check out one
      of those conferences at least once. So I tried to find
      one which is interesting but sadly soon forgot about
      it, because I couldn{`'`}t find a suitable one. But then, after
      a long time had passed, I noticed on Twitter that there
      was one about JavaScript starting in Berlin. And since
      I already really liked JS, I brought myself to do it.
    </P>

    <P>
      Now there was only one problem which was standing
      between me and the conference: Money. I don{`'`}t know
      exactly why, but I thought a ticket for it would cost
      around 100 euros and then turned out to be over
      700 (or something like that). And then there was
      also the cost for the train ticket and my accommodation
      for three nights. All in all, it was a bit over a
      thousand euros for just two days of talks and All
      You Can Eat Food. It was just too much. But as soon
      as I got sad about that I probably wouldn{`'`}t be
      able to attend the event, their Twitter account
      tweeted about how easy it is to get a scholarship
      if you{`'`}re part of a small, ethnic group. I
      wasn{`'`}t, so I got sad again.
    </P>

    <P>
      Thankfully, they told me that they could even
      sponsor {`"`}regular{`"`} people like me if I
      couldn{`'`}t afford it. So on the same
      day, I sent out an application through their web
      form and hoped that I would be selected as one
      of the small group of people which will receive a sponsorship.
    </P>

    <P>
      Then one day, I got an email with {`"`}Congrats,
      you{`'`}re going to Berlin!{`"`} in the subject
      line. It was from Simone, one of the great people
      who spent their time organizing those huge
      meetups. And then it started, I got really nervous
      immediately. I knew I will meet new people
      who{`'`}re indeed on the same topic as I, but
      definitely on a different level. But I tried to
      tell myself to stay calm and booked a nice little
      room on Airbnb and packed by stuff for
      the 4-hour trip to Berlin.
    </P>

    <P>
      It was a long, exhausting ride on a train with
      really bad WiFi and omnipresent nausea. But
      I{`'`}ve managed to distract myself with music and
      the development of a website which will
      launch soon<Ref id="1" />.
    </P>

    <P>
      As I finally arrived there, I was immediately
      blown away by all those huge buildings, huge crowds
      of business people in grey suits rushing to work
      and students sitting on benches while looking
      strained into books, drinking Starbucks coffee
      and gulping down all kinds of fast food. All in
      all it didn{`'`}t felt like a cozy town to me. But
      much more like a instrument of power which was
      purely created to fit a huge amount of people
      in one place and impress other countries.
    </P>

    <P>
      It was definitely the result of the megalomania
      of Germany{`'`}s past politician that I felt like
      I was being crushed by endlessly high castles and
      blocks made of pure concrete and glass.
    </P>

    <P>
      Maybe the bombing in the second world war
      and the thereupon as-fast-as-possible created
      buildings played a part in this.
    </P>

    <P>
      After walking a bit, a huge quadrangular
      block made of pure concrete and glass showed
      up in front of me. I looked on the sign that
      tells the walkers what is being build here
      and it said something like {`"`}The new Berlin castle{`"`}.
    </P>

    <P>
      I took a big step away from the fence, stared at
      the lifeless built and thought {`"`}That{`'`}s not
      a castle, you must be kidding me{`"`}. Then I walked a
      little further and found another sign (more like a
      plastic poster) which showed the number 60
      written in red letters. Under it, there was a text
      in a different font which said {`"`}Current
      liabilities of the city in billions{`"`}.
    </P>

    <P>
      Yeah, sure. {`"`}Guys, we haven{`'`}t spend enough
      of our country{`'`}s money yet. Let{`'`}s build a
      crappy looking concrete block for another few
      millions!{`"`}. I guess that pretty much sums
      up my feelings about Berlin. There are definitely
      some great spots, but most if it is just not my thing.
    </P>

    <H2>The Conference</H2>

    <P>
      Now enough with that talking about the city
      itself. While I was there, I didn{`'`}t just sit
      around for 4 days, I actually did something. The
      main reason why I even visited Berlin was because
      of my first web
      conference, the
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://2015.jsconf.eu/">JSConf EU</Link>
      . It
      {`'`}
      s a
      nice event with great food and friendly
      people who{`'`}re presenting cool things
      that are happing around JavaScript.
    </P>

    <P>
      Before the first day of the event, I was very
      nervous and went to bed very late. In the morning, I
      woke up early too, just to notice that
      I haven{`'`}t brought my hairdryer with me. Fuck. Once
      I had figured out how to towel them down, the event
      had already started and I prayed that the breakfast is
      still going. Thankfully, I had a few minutes to
      enjoy my pancakes with jam, before the halls
      got opened for the audience.
    </P>

    <P>
      Then, the whole room suddenly got completely
      darkened. The only things that were still visible
      were the bright-shining screens of those people, who
      decided not to close their MacBooks for a fucking
      second. I knew that they would come up with a great
      opening, but I did neither
      expect
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://vimeo.com/140427080">this</Link>
      , nor
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://youtu.be/lJ1kY-CSpBk">that</Link>
      .
    </P>

    <P>
      After the beginning, the crew introduced themselves
      and the talks started. It was a great journey through
      all the areas, in which JavaScript is now being used
      to create great things. I felt like they really took
      the whole {`"`}JavaScript everything{`"`} as an attitude
      for life. I heard of a sewing machine running it and Pawel
      Szymczykowski showed us how to build a balloon carrying a payload of
      sensors and cameras which will by launched into
      the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, all thanks to node.
    </P>

    <P>
      I don{`'`}t want to dig too much into all the great stuff
      that was shown to us, because all of them will be released
      in the next days on
      their
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jsconfeu/videos">
        YouTube channel
      </Link>
      . I
      {`'`}
      m
      sadly now able to tell you my favorite talk, because most
      of them were just above ground. But one of those was
      definitely {`"`}Illusion of Time{`"`} by Denys
      Mishunov (where he explained why people don{`'`}t care
      about waiting if they{`'`}re able to move forward while
      they wait and why they do care if they need to wait
      without doing anything) and {`"`}Disconnected
      Networking{`"`} by Razvan Caliman. In this one, he
      showed us how to use various APIs (like audio or
      ambient light) of the newer browser versions to
      transfer data between devices or simply control a computer with gestures.
    </P>

    <P>
      Another thing I was very happy about was, that
      Microsoft finally decided to kill the Internet
      Explorer in favor of their new browser: Edge. They
      dropped a huge amount of old code lines and replaced
      them with all the cool features which browsers like
      Chrome already have since a long time. When I got
      back to my agency, I had the chance to install
      Windows 10 on one of our testing devices and I
      noticed that they haven{`'`}t completely removed
      IE yet. But I{`'`}m sure they will, in the near future.
    </P>

    <P>
      I also met David Valdman, the creator of the
      talk {`"`}Functional Layout - Updating the DOM
      at 60FPS{`"`} (which happened in a different hall at
      the same time) and we were chatting a bit
      about how big Berlin is and that it{`'`}s not
      comparable to all the beatiful cities we actually
      have in Germany. Thanks to him, I{`'`}m now also
      aware of how much projects like JSConf do to get
      some decent talks for their audience. No matter
      where you live, they will pay for your flight, your
      accommodation and for all your human needs (food, drinks, et cetera).
    </P>

    <P>
      All in all, it was a really great event. Altought
      I didn{`'`}t really know where to go at first, I
      found it out a short while later because everything
      was so perfectly organized and explaned through signs and
      the crew. Someone even built a full
      mobile version of the schedule, so
      it was very easy to switch halls if the
      current talk wasn{`'`}t very interesting.
    </P>

    <P>
      Oh, I forgot to mention that: The whole event
      took place in two different rooms: The {`"`}Back
      track{`"`} (where I was most of the time) and
      the {`"`}Side track{`"`}. Everyone was allowed
      to change to the other room if the talk on
      the other side was more appealing to him, or just for fun.
    </P>

    <P>
      Sadly, I wasn{`'`}t able to stay until the Closing
      Conference and the Group Foto. Since I didn{`'`}t knew
      the schedule when I booked my tickets, I bought one of
      those for the train which can only be used at a certain
      time. I was so thankful that I{`'`}ve received the
      sponsorship, but I still wanted to find the cheapest
      ticket so that I could spend more money on the Airbnb
      room (which was
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://www.airbnb.de/rooms/7643348">this one</Link>
      , by
      the way). I was very late when I{`'`}ve decided to book a
      room on Airbnb instead of one in a hotel, so there
      where only a few ones left.
    </P>

    <P>But as you can see, I got a great one anyway - it was beatiful!</P>

    <H2>TL;DR;</H2>

    <P>
      If you have the chance to attend one of
      those web conferences, do it! You will meet a lot
      of great people, stay up-to-date with the new stuff
      in our industry and also have a lot of fun!
    </P>

    <P>
      On of the biggest problems I personally had
      was simply being too shy to do it. But trust me, those
      people are a lot nicer than the the average
      person you{`'`}ll meet on the street!
