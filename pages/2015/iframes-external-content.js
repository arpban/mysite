    <P>
      If you{`'`}re moving around the web once in a while, you certainly
      already know about them: iframes. They have been accompanying
      us since Netscape 2 and still haven{`'`}t lost much of their
      popularity (although there are many other ways to load content
      of other websites into your site). Even big players
      like Twitter, Facebook or Google are using them to provide
      easy implementations of their data for developers.
    </P>

    <P>
      The reason behind that is, that iframes have been the
      best way to embed content that can{`'`}t be modified
      by the existing styling of the site which it is
      getting loaded in. â€” But no longer!
    </P>

    <H2>CSS3 to the Rescue...!</H2>

    <P>
      While digging through Mozilla{`'`}s CSS docs, I was searching
      for a proper way to allow other developers to use a
      JS library<Ref id="1" /> I was planning without needing to embed
      an iframe. It{`'`}s the same problem that Twitter has
      with it
      {`'`}
      s
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-tweets">
        embedded tweets
      </Link>
      , I
      just don
      {`'`}
      t want my plugin
      {`'`}
      s styling to get changed by the existing.
    </P>

    <P>
      So after looking around a bit, I
      found
      {' '}
      <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">
        all
      </Link>
      . I
      literally cried tears of joy. The guys over at W3C finally
      managed to create a stable solution to reset all stylings
      for an element. And that{`'`}s exactly what the
      property does, in a nutshell.
    </P>

    <P>
      It helps you to get rid of every decleration. And when I
      say every, I mean every. You might think it resets the styling
      to match the default formatting... Hehe, nope! Every
      property is getting removed.
    </P>

    <P>Okay, let me explain that with an example:</P>

    <Code language="css" syntax={css}>
      {`h1 {
  all: unset;
}`}
    </Code>

    <P>
      ... doesn{`'`}t just change the heading{`'`}s (let{`'`}s say) font-size
      to 2em (which is the default one in
      HTML5). <i>No!</i> It set{`'`}s the font size to 100%.
    </P>

    <P>
      Now you got it, right? Cool! Then let{`'`}s talk about the
      possible cases in which we could use this property. One could be
      to solve the problem with iframes: They require your
      content to be completely put together in a HTML document
      on your server, before you can serve it. Then people are
      able to embed it into their site. But what if you don{`'`}t want that?
    </P>

    <P>
      Instead of providing a fixed iframe for their embedded
      tweets, Twitter (as an example) could also supply developers with
      a JS script that pulls the tweet through their JSON API and
      then put it into a simple div (or maybe into an
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>blockquote</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      tag, if
      you want it to be semantic). There would only be one
      problem: Twitter couldn{`'`}t provide a pre-defined styling for
      the embedded Tweet because it would be overridden.
    </P>

    <P>But they could! â€” If they start using the {`'`}all{`'`}-property now!</P>

    <P>
      Doing so, would remove all styles set by the site itself and
      give Twitter the change to apply their own beautiful tweet-like style.
    </P>

    <H2>Other Use-Cases</H2>

    <P>
      As I already indicated, using the property as a faster alternative
      for iframes is not the only possible case where it can find
      application. Just think about how great it would be to be able
      to code a jQuery plugin which styles can{`'`}t be overriden, for example.
    </P>

    <P>
      As many CSS properties I like to talk of, this one is
      very new<Ref id="2" />. Nevertheless all major browsers (except Safari of
      course) are already able to interpret it. So
      let{`'`}s go, start using it today!
    </P>
