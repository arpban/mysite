    <P>
      The last time I came in contact with CloudFlare, I was
      managing root servers for my own tiny
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://frewhost.net">hosting-provider</Link>
      {' '}
      and it looked
      like a really neat way to get rid of those damn
      DDoS attacks my service was getting back then. Unfortunately, their
      system wasn’t as functional and good-looking as it is today, so I struggled
      pretty hard with actually configuring it and getting everything running.
    </P>

    <P>
      But that also has a good side: I learned a lot about DNS
      records, the way how name-servers work and what it
      actually means to look after hundreds of domains.
    </P>

    <P>
      Thanks to this experience, I was now able to easily get started
      with their improved service on my new site and hell
      yeah, it works like a charm. While browsing through the
      different options, I noticed that it’s exactly what GitHub
      wasn’t able to accomplish by itself. — I know, the
      most plausible reason is probably that they simple didn’t see
      a need for that. But I do. And if you carefully checked
      your own site and looked for ways to improve it’s performance, you also do.
    </P>

    <H2>Browser Caching</H2>

    <P>
      The problem with GitHub pages is that many people were misusing
      it. Therefore it’s creators needed to find a balance between maximum speed and
      safety. The first thing that should come to your mind now is
      caching: Neither does Pages offer a way to change the expiration
      date of your files, nor did they set the default timeout to
      something high. To be more precise, it’s currently at
      around 10 minutes. They reason why they did that is probably that
      many silly developers were using Pages as a CDN for their assets or public libraries.
    </P>

    <P>
      While your site’s content will actually be hosted on
      Fastly’s CDN (they’ve partnered with GitHub), you shouldn’t share
      the URL of the files on your site as a central embedding
      point for every developer on the world.
    </P>

    <P>
      Because many of us didn’t respect this rule, they simply
      prohibited us from accessing those parameters. And here
      comes CloudFlare. You simply change your domain’s NS records
      to a few hostnames which their wizard suggests and after a
      few hours, you are able to enjoy all of CloudFlare’s advantages regarding caching:
    </P>

    <P>
      You can now easily change the expiration date of your files or
      even minify HTML, CSS and JS. And that’s what
      brings us to the next stage:
    </P>

    <H2>Minifying Stuff</H2>

    <P>
      Before I came back to CloudFlare because I needed a
      few name servers for my new domain, I was minifying the
      HTML code using a tacky Jekyll layout written in Liquid.
    </P>

    <P>
      I knew it’s not a real solution for this problem, but back then, I was pretty
      happy about it because it did exactly what Pages couldn’t do: Remove
      unnecessary characters from my files before serving them to the visitor.
    </P>

    <P>
      Since it was just a layout, the HTML code was filtered through
      it and when it came out, it was minified like every good library
      would do it. But as I already said it, I just felt dirty while using
      it. And that’s not because it’s creator made shitty decisions (in
      terms of what was possible for him, he actually made a
      piece of art), but rather because a layout shouldn’t be used for such a purpose.
    </P>

    <P>
      Thanks to CloudFlare, this is now history too. The only thing
      I needed to do was set some checkmarks in their dashboard and
      now all my files are being minified before they’re served. Since
      that process would take too much time on-the-fly, those parts
      are currently being cached on their servers. Although that means
      that I need to clear the cache manually every time I make changes
      to my site (as far as I understood it), I’m very happy about it.
    </P>

    <P>
      Because from now on, the development process will be a
      bit easier for me and for contributors. All code lines are expanded
      by default, which means easier debugging for everyone!
    </P>

    <H2>DDoS Protection</H2>

    <P>
      Besides making it faster, CloudFlare also protects my site
      from small to mid-scale DDoS attacks by serving the
      contents from a different server on their global DNS, in case that the
      origin server on GitHub’s cluster goes offline.
    </P>

    <P>
      By the way, this also decreases the time requests from
      clients take to reach my site. By using their name-servers, the average ping
      latency dropped from around 140ms to less than 30ms. This
      means that the delay between a page request and the answer from the
      server will be much smaller and this in turn means that
      the site loads faster.
    </P>

    <H2>Analytics</H2>

    <P>
      To be honest, I never was a fan of Google Analytics. When I implemented
      it into my site a few months ago, I only did this because GitHub sadly
      doesn’t provide any way to get an overview of how many people
      are visiting your site. But as you might have thought it already: CloudFlare
      does provide one. Thanks to this feature, I was able to
      completely remove Google’s tracking code from my site while
      still being aware of the number of unique visitors or hits my site actually gets.
    </P>

    <P>
      Besides that, their dashboard even tells me about the
      origin of the traffic, how much bandwidth was used and
      how many unwanted threats were blocked by their infrastructure. And
      for me, that’s all I need. If I wanted to know which browsers
      my visitors are using, I could simply look at a chart from W3C.
    </P>

    <P>
      All in all, this also has the nice side-effect that the data
      isn’t being sold to third-party folks (at least I don’t think that
      this is where CloudFlare gets its hugest revenue
      from, compared to companies like Google).
    </P>

    <Tweet id="624669416299589635" className="tweet"/>

    <P>
      I’m sure that he wasn’t talking about the way how Google uses the
      information that it gets from Analytics, but rather
      if the cookies set by their services are also used for advertising purposes on
      completely different sites. But as you can see, there
      are many influential people wondering about what’s actually
      happing with their users data.
    </P>

    <P>
      And I definitely don’t want to be part of them, so I’m stopping
      this madness right now by keeping only the data I need and
      also not within the clients browser.
    </P>

    <P>
      In terms of performance, this kind of analytics-management also
      saves a lot of overhead that was triggered by all the requests that
      were made by the client to get those huge bags of
      scripts and other files from the Google’s servers, just for the
      purpose of recording one hit.
    </P>

    <P>
      And if that wasn’t enough, those scripts only have a expiration
      date of 2 hours. I firstly thought that they did this because
      they need to save the requests of the same users over and over
      again, but then I figured out that this would also be possible if the expiration
      date was set to something better (like one week).
    </P>

    <P>So in the end, I don’t have a clue why they’re even doing this.</P>

    <P>
      But enough with this stuff: At CloudFlare, this happens seamlessly
      on the server. As soon as a request comes in, the page gets
      served and at the same time, the web-server takes note of the
      client’s IP address and location data by simply extracting them from the
      parameters which were sent with the request — no additional overhead.
    </P>

    <P>Sounds like a great deal, huh?</P>

    <P>
      But before I forget it: If you want to take advantage of those
      improvements, you not only need to use CloudFlare’s DNS network, but also
      their other services built for the purpose of
      accelerating and protecting your site.
    </P>

    <P>
      After logging into their dashboard and opening
      the “DNS” section, you’ll have to choose if you just want to use their
      DNS system, or also all the other great things.
    </P>

    <P>
      Now I finally found a neat way to combine the DNS-resolution of my
      domain name with all the other stuff that makes my site even faster
      and easier to manage in the development process.
    </P>

    <HR />

    <P>
      After a few hours with CloudFlare’s analytics tool, I found out
      about another great advantage over Google’s way of doing
      it: I’m finally able to track how many people are reading my posts through RSS. ♥️
    </P>

    <P>
      That’s only the case because the visits are being
      recorded on the back-end instead of on the front-end, like it was before.
