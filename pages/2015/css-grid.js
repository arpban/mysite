    <P>
      A few minutes ago, I read a
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://bit.ly/2iQvY4g">post</Link>
      {' '}
      on
      Designer News that was created by a guy that wanted to create
      another flexbox-based grid framework for CSS. He probably
      knew that there are already many of them out there. But
      that didn{`'`}t held him back from asking for interest in another one.
    </P>

    <P>
      The reason behind that is for sure that he just likes coding
      and also sees a thin gap for really great grid
      frameworks. Because I want people to stay motivated on
      their idea (no matter how many other guys already
      made it happen), I generally think it{`'`}s not a bad
      idea to create another one. <b>BUT</b> only if he{`'`}s doing
      it for the purpose of learning and not for other people. ðŸ˜‰
    </P>

    <P>
      <b>Why?</b> Because the need for those kinds of frameworks
      will soon be gone forever. â€” Okay, that might be a
      bit confusing for you know, so let{`'`}s start with a quick explanation:
    </P>

    <P>
      I don{`'`}t know how you do it, but since a few years I have
      been using grid frameworks to align content properly and
      create responsive web layouts. With the time, a couple of
      aspects on the initial idea have changed: Websites are now
      mostly being designed mobile-first (fortunately) and
      flexbox allowed us to reach our goal of creating a effective
      CSS-layout more quickly by providing us with properties
      that can help us to equate the height of columns
      lined up in a row without knowing their content{`'`}s size
      or using a mushy JS mixture that does this job.
    </P>

    <P>
      Until now, this was pretty much the best way to create a proper
      website layout (without writing a custom grid of course). Fortunately,
      we{`'`}re now finally getting redeemed from this heavy
      performance load - thanks to <InlineCode>grid</InlineCode>.
    </P>

    <H2>{`What's So Good about It?`}</H2>

    <P>
      It{`'`}s basically
      a
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/">new CSS method</Link>
      {' '}
      that allows us
      to easily create beautiful web-layouts without a huge
      grid framework. No matter how tiny the budget of the
      client and how short your available time will be,
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>grid</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      provides
      you with many different properties which tell the browser
      how to position an element within the design.
    </P>

    <P>
      And the best thing about that: It seems like the browser
      just doesn{`'`}t care about the position of the element within
      the HTML code. For example, a column that you want to show
      on the top right edge of the browser window can be placed
      right before the body tag closes (after all other elements).
    </P>

    <P>
      It
      {`'`}
      s kind of like using
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>position: absolute</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      but
      without needing to specify the position of
      the element with pixels. <i>
        The grid will figure it
        out by itself.
      </i> â€” W3C describes this
      behaviour as
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#source-independence">
        source-order independence
      </Link>
      .
    </P>

    <H2>Browser Support</H2>

    <P>
      Because it{`'`}s a pretty new technology, there{`'`}s currently only
      one browser that supports it by default: You won{`'`}t believe
      me if I tell you ... *laughs* ... I just ... okay, it{`'`}s our always
      beloved friend, the Internet Explorer. But no
      worries, you won{`'`}t completely sink into confusion here: You still
      need to use the <InlineCode>-ms</InlineCode> prefix. Now it
      makes a bit more sense, right? *laughs*
    </P>

    <P>
      Anyway. If you don{`'`}t use IE (*shame on you*) you{`'`}re also
      able to enable it through the {`"`}experimental Web
      Platform features{`"`} flag
      in <InlineCode>chrome://flags</InlineCode> within Chrome or Opera.
    </P>

    <H2>So Just an Alternative to Flexbox?</H2>

    <P>
      <b>No!</b> â€” Don{`'`}t start running and yelling {`'`}Fuck you
      flexbox{`'`} around in your office, WE STILL NEED IT!
    </P>

    <P>
      Those two properties are meant to be used for two
      completely different cases. The first -
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>display: grid</InlineCode>
      {' '}
      - can
      be used to create the general layout of
      your web- app or -site but not to align the {`"`}boxes{`"`} that contain
      the content. This is where `display: flex` claims
      your attention. It should be used to put all columns
      in one row to the same height for example.
    </P>

    <P>Okay, let{`'`}s sum up for which each property should be used:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><b>grid:</b> â€” Layout</LI>
      <LI><b>flex:</b> â€” Content</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>I think that{`'`}s pretty easy to understand, isn{`'`}t it? ðŸ˜¸</P>

    <P>
      So what are you waiting for? Open Chrome, enable that
      experimental flag and try the shit out of
      {' '}
      <InlineCode>grid</InlineCode>
      ! If you get
      stuck or simply want to know more about how the property
      exactly works and how it should be used, take a look at
      the
      {' '}
      <Link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/">W3C documentation</Link>
      .
    </P>

    <P>
      There are much more use cases for it to discover and
      we should all participate in it{`'`}s development. I think
      it{`'`}s a really huge step into the direction of a world
      that{`'`}s free of performance- and memory-draining CSS frameworks.
